Students should focus on understanding the interplay between the code, the data, and the resulting analysis or visualization.]](https://youtu.be/b6puvm-QEY0)\n\n- Wikipedia Library - [Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UZky5JdOn2oMYIkls23WefTaT8VinYyg)\n- Learn about the [`wikipedia` package](https://wikipedia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n## Image labelling with chess pieces\n\n[[Image Description: The image \"Image labelling with chess pieces\" likely shows a visual exercise demonstrating image annotation or labelling, a common task in computer vision and machine learning.  The image probably uses a chessboard or a selection of chess pieces as the visual subject.  Here's what a student might expect to see:\n\n* **A visual scene:**  The central focus is a picture or image, possibly a photograph or a drawing, featuring a chessboard setup, individual pieces, or a combination of both.  The arrangement might be simple (a few pieces) or complex (a mid-game position).\n\n* **Bounding Boxes or other labels:**  Overlaid on the image will be annotations identifying the different elements. This could be accomplished in several ways:\n\n    * **Bounding boxes:** Rectangular boxes drawn around each chess piece, clearly defining its location.  These boxes might be different colors to distinguish between types of pieces (e.g., red for pawns, blue for knights, etc.).\n    * **Polygonal segmentation:** Instead of boxes, more precise outlines might be used to accurately trace the shape of each piece.\n    * **Text labels:** Inside or next to the bounding boxes or polygons, there would be text labels identifying each piece: \"Pawn,\" \"Rook,\" \"Knight,\" \"Bishop,\" \"Queen,\" \"King.\"  These labels might even include additional information like color (\"White Pawn,\" \"Black Rook\").\n    * **Numerical labels:**  Instead of text, numbers could be used to distinguish different pieces, with a key providing a translation of each number to its corresponding piece.\n\n\n* **The purpose:** The overall aim of the image is to illustrate how image labelling works.  It shows a concrete example of identifying and categorizing objects within a larger scene.  This is crucial for training computer algorithms to recognize and understand images.  The simplicity of the chess pieces makes it an easily understandable example, as the pieces are clearly distinct and visually different.\n\n\nIn short, the image is a clear, easily understood visual aid for explaining the process of image annotation and its importance in machine learning and computer vision.  The familiar imagery of chess makes the concept readily accessible to students.]](https://youtu.be/OTRamjRb7P4)\n\n- [Image dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niteshfre/chessman-image-dataset)\n- [Chess Pawns Excel file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/156zEzw4al4Onx5IGPvhF8GbEj1TQ6Bqz/edit#gid=1998348575)\n- [Jupyter Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xWILF9ifT2ifTYv4EXPUiB58Ts0-O9Bo?usp=sharing)\n- Learn about the [PIL module](https://pypi.org/project/pillow/), [reference](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [video](https://youtu.be/dkp4wUhCwR4)\n- Learn about the [BeautifulSoup module](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#quick-start) and [video](https://youtu.be/XVv6mJpFOb0)\n- Learn about the [io module](https://pymotw.com/3/io/), [reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html) and [video](https://youtu.be/cIaOisyd7lE)\n\n## Forecasting time series with Python\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"Forecasting time series with Python\" indicates an image likely depicting a tutorial, code example, or visual representation of time series forecasting using the Python programming language.

The image likely depicts various techniques, possibly represented visually through icons, diagrams, or a combination thereof.  Here's a breakdown of what a student might expect to see and how to interpret it:\n\n**Possible Elements & Interpretations:**\n\n* **Data Masking/Suppression:**  This might be shown as a graphic obscuring parts of a data entry (e.g., covering the last four digits of a social security number or blurring parts of an address).  The caption might read \"Masking\" or \"Suppression.\"  The student should understand this as a technique that selectively hides sensitive information while still allowing for data analysis.\n\n* **Data Generalization/Aggregation:**  This could be represented by a visual showing individual data points being grouped into larger categories or ranges. For example, specific ages might be grouped into age brackets (e.g., 20-29, 30-39). The caption might describe this as \"Generalization\" or \"Aggregation.\" The student should understand that this reduces the granularity of the data, making it harder to identify individuals.\n\n* **Data Pseudonymization:**  This might be shown as a process of replacing identifying information with pseudonyms or unique identifiers.  This could be visualized as a key or mapping linking the original identifier to a substitute. The caption might be \"Pseudonymization\" or \"Data Swapping\". The student should understand this as replacing real identifiers with artificial ones while maintaining data relationships.\n\n* **Tokenization:**  This could be illustrated with a process showing sensitive data being replaced with non-sensitive tokens. These tokens are only meaningful when interpreted using a separate key.  The caption could be \"Tokenization.\" The student should understand this as a way to replace sensitive data with unique, but meaningless, tokens.\n\n* **Differential Privacy:**  This is a more advanced concept and might be shown as a process adding noise to the data to protect individual entries while preserving overall data patterns. This would likely involve a more complex diagram showing the addition of random noise.  The student should be aware that this adds a degree of uncertainty to the data but makes it much harder to identify any single individual's information.\n\n* **Hashing:**  This might be shown as a one-way function transforming data into a unique, irreversible string. The caption should specify this as \"Hashing\".  The student should understand that hashing transforms data into an unreadable format that is difficult to reverse engineer to retrieve the original information.\n\n**How to use the image for learning:**\n\nThe image acts as a visual aid summarizing different anonymization techniques. Students should focus on:\n\n* **Understanding the visual representation:** Each icon or diagram should be clearly labeled, enabling students to connect the visual with the specific method.\n\n* **Connecting visual with definition:** Students should relate each visual representation to its textual definition.\n\n* **Identifying strengths and limitations:** Students should consider the strengths and limitations of each technique, considering what information is preserved and what is lost.  This involves understanding the trade-off between data privacy and data utility.\n\n\nIn short, the image serves as a quick reference for various data anonymization methods. By carefully examining the visuals and their accompanying labels, students can gain a valuable overview of the tools used to protect sensitive information in data analysis.]](https://youtu.be/N8I-sxmMfqQ)\n\n- [List of Tools](https://aircloak.com/top-5-free-data-anonymization-tools/)\n\n## Libraries to build web applications\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"Libraries to build web applications\" suggests an image illustrating various JavaScript (or potentially other language) libraries commonly used in web development.

Instead of just \"Surveys,\" it should show an image of a survey or mention a specific type of survey.\n* **Context:** The context within which the image is presented (e.g., a lesson on research methods, data analysis) greatly influences its interpretation.\n\n\nTo give a more precise description, please provide the image itself or a more detailed description of its contents.]](https://youtu.be/GY5l_5RpVZM)\n\n- [Awesome public datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)\n- [Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)\n- [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/)\n- [Data.gov](https://data.gov/) and [Data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/)\n- [Datameet](https://datameet.org/)\n\n## Types of datasets\n\n[[Image Description: The image titled \"Types of Datasets\" likely shows a visual representation categorizing different kinds of datasets used in data science, statistics, and machine learning.  Without seeing the image, I can only speculate on its contents, but it probably uses a visual structure like a flowchart, tree diagram, or Venn diagram to illustrate the relationships between the dataset types.\n\nHere are some possible ways the image might categorize datasets, and what a student should look for:\n\n* **By data structure:** This is a common way to categorize datasets.  The image might show branches for:\n    * **Structured Data:**  Organized in a predefined format, often relational databases with tables and rows (like CSV or SQL databases).  The image might mention examples like customer information with columns for name, address, and purchase history.\n    * **Semi-structured Data:**  Doesn't conform to a rigid table format but has some organizational properties, like XML or JSON files.  The image might give examples like social media posts or log files.\n    * **Unstructured Data:**  Doesn't follow a predefined format and is typically textual or multimedia data.  Examples shown might include images, audio files, videos, or free-form text documents.\n\n* **By data type:**  The image may classify datasets based on the type of values they contain:\n    * **Numerical Data:**  Quantitative data represented by numbers (e.g., height, weight, temperature).  The image may further subdivide this into discrete (whole numbers) and continuous (decimal numbers).\n    * **Categorical Data:**  Qualitative data representing categories or groups (e.g., colors, gender, types of fruit).  The image might mention nominal (unordered categories) and ordinal (ordered categories).\n    * **Time Series Data:** Data collected over time, often at regular intervals (e.g., stock prices, weather data).\n\n* **By data size:** The image could show categories related to the volume of data:\n    * **Small datasets:** Easily manageable on a personal computer.\n    * **Large datasets (Big Data):**  Require specialized tools and techniques for storage and processing.  The image might mention characteristics like volume, velocity, and variety.\n\n* **By data source:**  The image could categorize datasets according to their origin:\n    * **Primary data:**  Collected directly by the researcher.\n    * **Secondary data:**  Collected by someone else and used by the researcher.\n\n\n**To effectively use the image for learning, a student should:**\n\n* **Identify the main categories:** What are the primary ways the datasets are grouped?\n* **Understand the relationships:** How do different types of datasets relate to each other? Are there overlaps?\n* **Examine the examples:** Pay attention to the illustrative examples provided for each category.  These will help solidify understanding.\n* **Consider the applications:**  Think about where each type of dataset would be used in real-world applications.\n\nBy carefully analyzing the visual structure and the information provided, the student will gain a clearer understanding of the different types of datasets and their characteristics.]](https://youtu.be/u8PIxqsi1kk)\n\n- Structured data has a schema: Databases, Spreadsheets, Forms, Shapefiles\n- Semi-structured data has a flexible schema: JSON, HTML, Email\n- Unstructured data has no schema: Text, Images, Audio, Video\n- [DBF opener](https://www.dbfopener.com/)\n- [MapShaper lets you view Shapefiles](https://mapshaper.org/)\n\n## Types of values\n\n[[Image Description: The image titled \"Types of Values\" likely presents a categorization of values, showing how different values relate to each other.  Without seeing the image itself, I can only speculate on its contents, but here are some possibilities of what it might depict:\n\n**Possible Representations:**\n\n* **Hierarchical Structure:**  A pyramid or tree-like diagram showing a hierarchy of values.  At the top might be overarching values like \"well-being\" or \"meaning,\" branching down into more specific values like \"health,\" \"family,\" \"knowledge,\" \"creativity,\" \"justice,\" etc.  This would illustrate how some values might be considered more fundamental or foundational than others.\n\n* **Categorical Breakdown:** A chart or table organizing values into distinct categories, such as:\n    * **Instrumental Values:** Values that help achieve other goals (e.g., hard work, honesty, responsibility).\n    * **Terminal Values:**  Values representing desired end states (e.g., happiness, security, freedom).\n    * **Personal Values:** Values relating to individual self-concept (e.g., independence, creativity, self-respect).\n    * **Social Values:** Values concerning relationships and society (e.g., fairness, equality, compassion).\n    * **Moral Values:** Values that guide ethical behavior (e.g., honesty, integrity, justice).\n\n* **Venn Diagram:** A Venn diagram could show the overlap and intersection between different value types, illustrating how values might be interconnected and sometimes conflict. For instance, the circles could represent \"financial security,\" \"environmental sustainability,\" and \"social justice,\" showing areas of overlap and conflict.\n\n* **List or Table with Descriptions:** A simple list or table with various values and brief descriptions, possibly categorized as mentioned above.\n\n\n**Student Assistance:**\n\nTo best understand the image, students should look for:\n\n* **Key Terms:**  Identify the specific value categories or types used in the image.\n* **Relationships:** Observe how different values are related to each other (hierarchy, categories, overlaps).\n* **Definitions:** Pay attention to any provided definitions or descriptions of the values.\n* **Examples:** Note the examples used to illustrate each value type.\n* **Visual Cues:**  Analyze the use of color, size, and placement to understand the importance or relationships between the values.\n\n\nBy carefully examining the visual organization and the textual elements, students can gain a clear understanding of the different types of values and their interrelationships, as presented in the image.  If the image is available, providing a description of its specific visual elements would allow for a more precise and helpful explanation.]](https://youtu.be/HlsqT0r9wAM)\n\n- Categorical values may be:\n  - Boolean: True or False\n  - Unordered: No order, like colors\n  - Ordered: Order, like ratings\n  - Cyclical: Like days of the week\n  - Unstructured: Like names, images\n- Numerical values may be:\n  - Integer: You can add or subtract\n  - Real: You can multiply or divide\n- Composite values have an internal structure\n  - Temporal: Date, Time\n  - Spatial: Latitude, Longitude, Shapefiles\n  - Structured: JSON, XML with schema\n  - Specialized: IP addresses, URLs, Email addresses, Phone numbers, etc.\n\n## Week Summary\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"Discover the Data - Summary\" suggests an image summarizing key findings from a dataset.  Without seeing the image, I can only speculate on its contents, but it likely uses visual elements to convey information efficiently.  Here are some possibilities, depending on the type of data:\n\n**Possible Content and Interpretations:**\n\n* **Charts and Graphs:**  The image could contain a bar chart showing comparisons, a pie chart illustrating proportions, a line graph depicting trends over time, or a scatter plot revealing correlations.  Look for clear labels on axes and legends to understand what the data represents.  The summary might highlight the most significant trends or outliers.\n\n* **Tables:** A concise table summarizing key statistics could be present. This might include means, medians, standard deviations, or percentages. Look for clear column and row headers to understand what each value represents.\n\n* **Infographics:** The image may be an infographic combining charts, graphs, icons, and concise text to convey the main findings in an easily digestible format.  Pay attention to the visual hierarchy – larger elements are generally more important.\n\n* **Key Findings Text:**  The image could simply highlight the main conclusions drawn from the data analysis in bullet points or short paragraphs.  This approach would be best if the data was complex and a visual representation wasn't the most effective way to summarize it.\n\n* **Combination:**  It's likely the image combines several of these elements to provide a comprehensive summary.\n\n\n**For Student Assistance:**\n\nTo effectively use this image, students should:\n\n1. **Identify the Data Type:** What kind of data is being summarized (e.g., sales figures, student test scores, population demographics)?  The title or labels should give clues.\n\n2. **Understand the Visuals:** Decipher any charts, graphs, or tables.  Pay close attention to axis labels, legends, and any annotations.\n\n3. **Identify Key Trends and Patterns:** What are the most significant findings? Are there any noticeable trends or outliers?\n\n4. **Interpret the Summary:** If the image includes text, carefully read the key conclusions drawn from the data.\n\n5. **Connect to Context:** How do these findings relate to the larger context or research question?\n\n\nIn short, the image aims to present the core insights from a data analysis in a clear, concise, and visually appealing manner.  By systematically analyzing its components, students can gain a quick and effective understanding of the key takeaways.]](https://youtu.be/NNiFxgANu8Y)\n\nBased on what you have learnt in this module, you should be able to do two things: find data and understand what type of data it is.\n\nBoth of these are powerful skills.\n\nThe more data you are able to find, the more analysis that you will be able to do that others are unable to.\nTherefore, discovering new sources of data is a competitive advantage and a skill that is well worth building.\n\nThe other, in terms of understanding the type of data, will give you an edge in terms of knowing which data set is easier to work with.\nStructured data is easier to work with because you don't have to do any additional work.\nYou don't have to extract information from it.\nNumerical values are easier to work with than, let's say, categorical or composite because there's less effot to extract the structure.\nSo you'll be able to compare two data sets and say that one gets more results by spending in less time and effort.\n\n## Sample questions\n\n- Find the UCI machine learning dataset on Wine Quality.

    "content": "# Base 64 Encoding\n\nBase64 is a method to convert binary data into ASCII text. It's essential when you need to transmit binary data through text-only channels or embed binary content in text formats.\n\nWatch this quick explanation of how Base64 works (3 min):\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"What is Base64? (3 min)\" suggests an educational image explaining the concept of Base64 encoding.  The image likely contains visual elements designed to help students understand this topic quickly, within approximately 3 minutes.  Without seeing the image itself, I can only speculate on its contents, but it might include some or all of the following:\n\n* **A simple definition of Base64:**  A concise explanation of what Base64 is – a method for encoding binary data (like images, audio, or other files) into an ASCII string using only 64 characters (uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and '+' and '/').  This might be presented as a text box or a concise bullet point list.\n\n* **An example of Base64 encoding and decoding:** This is crucial for understanding. The image would probably show a piece of binary data (maybe represented visually as a sequence of bits or bytes) alongside its Base64 equivalent. Arrows would visually link the original data to its encoded form and vice-versa, demonstrating the transformation process.\n\n* **Visual representation of the 64 characters:** A chart or table displaying the 64 characters used in Base64 encoding might be included.\n\n* **A diagram illustrating the encoding process:** A flowchart or a simplified diagram that steps through how binary data is grouped, converted to base-64 characters, and padded (if necessary) could aid in comprehension.\n\n* **Use cases of Base64:** Examples of where Base64 is used, such as embedding images in HTML emails or storing data in configuration files, could be presented visually (perhaps with small icons or snippets of code).\n\n* **Advantages and disadvantages:**  A comparison chart briefly highlighting the pros (readability, portability) and cons (increased size of data, not suitable for all applications) of using Base64.\n\nIn short, the image aims to provide a quick, visually engaging introduction to Base64 encoding, suitable for a short learning session.  The focus is on conveying the core concept and functionality using visual aids rather than lengthy text explanations.]](https://youtu.be/8qkxeZmKmOY)\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n- It takes 3 bytes (24 bits) and converts them into 4 ASCII characters\n- ... using 64 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, + and / (padding with `=` to make the length a multiple of 4)\n- There's a URL-safe variant of Base64 that replaces + and / with - and \\_ to avoid issues in URLs\n- Base64 adds ~33% overhead (since every 3 bytes becomes 4 characters)\n\nCommon Python operations with Base64:\n\n```python\nimport base64\n\n# Basic encoding/decoding\ntext = \"Hello, World!\"\n# Convert text to base64\nencoded = base64.b64encode(text.encode()).decode()  # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\n# Convert base64 back to text\ndecoded = base64.b64decode(encoded).decode()        # Hello, World!\n# Convert to URL-safe base64\nurl_safe = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(text.encode()).decode()  # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\n\n# Working with binary files (e.g., images)\nwith open('image.png', 'rb') as f:\n    binary_data = f.read()\n    image_b64 = base64.b64encode(binary_data).decode()\n\n# Data URI example (embed images in HTML/CSS)\ndata_uri = f\"data:image/png;base64,{image_b64}\"\n```\n\nData URIs allow embedding binary data directly in HTML/CSS. This reduces the number of HTTP requests and also works offline. But it increases the file size.\n\nFor example, here's an SVG image embedded as a data URI:\n\n```html\n<img\n  src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzMiAzMiI+PGNpcmNsZSBjeD0iMTYiIGN5PSIxNiIgcj0iMTUiIGZpbGw9IiMyNTYzZWIiLz48cGF0aCBmaWxsPSIjZmZmIiBkPSJtMTYgNyAyIDcgNyAyLTcgMi0yIDctMi03LTctMiA3LTJaIi8+PC9zdmc+\"\n/>\n```\n\nBase64 is used in many places:\n\n- JSON: Encoding binary data in JSON payloads\n- Email: MIME attachments encoding\n- Auth: HTTP Basic Authentication headers\n- JWT: Encoding tokens in web authentication\n- SSL/TLS: PEM certificate format\n- SAML: Encoding assertions in SSO\n- Git: Encoding binary files in patches\n\nTools for working with Base64:\n\n- [Base64 Decoder/Encoder](https://www.base64decode.org/) for online encoding/decoding\n- [data: URI Generator](https://dopiaza.org/tools/datauri/index.php) converts files to Data URIs\n",

    "content": "## BBC Weather location ID with Python\n\n[[Image Description: This image likely depicts a tutorial or example showing how to use the BBC Weather location API with the Python programming language.  To assist students, let's break down what that means and what the image might contain:\n\n**What it shows:** The image probably illustrates the process of fetching weather data from the BBC Weather API using Python code.  This involves several key steps:\n\n1. **API Key and Authentication:**  The BBC Weather API likely requires an API key for access.  The image might show code that includes this key (although best practice would be to hide this in a configuration file, and not directly in the code shown).\n\n2. **Location Data:**  To get weather information, the user needs to specify a location. This could be done through geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) or a city name. The image might demonstrate how to input this location data into the Python code.\n\n3. **HTTP Request:**  The Python code uses an HTTP request (likely using libraries like `requests` or `urllib`) to send a query to the BBC Weather API's server. This request would include the API key and the specified location.\n\n4. **JSON Response:** The BBC Weather API would likely return the weather data in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format – a human-readable text format for structured data. The image might show the JSON response, illustrating the structure of the data received.\n\n5. **Data Parsing:**  The Python code then needs to parse this JSON response, extracting the relevant information (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).  The image might show code snippets demonstrating how to use Python's JSON handling capabilities to access specific data points within the JSON response.\n\n6. **Data Display:** Finally, the image might show how the extracted weather data is presented, perhaps in a simple print output to the console, or a more sophisticated visualization (although that might require additional libraries beyond the scope of just the API interaction).\n\n**What students should look for in the image:**  Students should focus on understanding the flow of information: how the location is specified, how the API is called, how the JSON response is handled, and how the data is extracted.  They should also pay attention to the Python code itself, noting the use of relevant libraries, functions (like those for making HTTP requests and parsing JSON), and variable assignments.\n\n**In short:** The image provides a visual representation of the process of accessing and utilizing external web APIs, a crucial skill in data science, software engineering, and many other fields. The focus is on the practical application of Python to interact with a weather data API.]](https://youtu.be/IafLrvnamAw)\n\nYou'll learn how to get the location ID of any city from the BBC Weather API -- as a precursor to scraping weather data -- covering:\n\n- **Understanding API Calls**: Learn how backend API calls work when searching for a city on the BBC weather website.\n- **Inspecting Web Interactions**: Use the browser's inspect element feature to track API calls and understand the network activity.\n- **Extracting Location IDs**: Identify and extract the location ID from the API response using Python.\n- **Using Python Libraries**: Import and use requests, json, and urlencode libraries to make API calls and process responses.\n- **Constructing API URLs**: Create structured API URLs dynamically with constant prefixes and query parameters using urlencode.\n- **Building Functions**: Develop a Python function that accepts a city name, constructs the API call, and returns the location ID.\n\nTo open the browser Developer Tools on Chrome, Edge, or Firefox, you can:\n\n- Right-click on the page and select \"Inspect\" to open the developer tools\n- OR: Press `F12`\n- OR: Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` on Windows\n- OR: Press `Cmd+Opt+I` on Mac\n\nHere are links and references:\n\n- [BBC Location ID scraping - Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-iV-tbtRicKR_HXWeu4Hi5aXJCV3QdQp)\n- [BBC Weather - Palo Alto (location ID: 5380748)](https://www.bbc.com/weather/5380748)\n- [BBC Locator Service - Los Angeles](https://locator-service.api.bbci.co.uk/locations?api_key=AGbFAKx58hyjQScCXIYrxuEwJh2W2cmv&stack=aws&locale=en&filter=international&place-types=settlement%2Cairport%2Cdistrict&order=importance&s=los%20angeles&a=true&format=json)\n- Learn about the [`requests` package](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/).

    "content": "## Converting HTML to Markdown\n\nWhen working with web content, converting HTML files to plain text or Markdown is a common requirement for content extraction, analysis, and preservation. For example:\n\n- **Content analysis**: Extract clean text from HTML for natural language processing\n- **Data mining**: Strip formatting to focus on the actual content\n- **Offline reading**: Convert web pages to readable formats for e-readers or offline consumption\n- **Content migration**: Move content between different CMS platforms\n- **SEO analysis**: Extract headings, content structure, and text for optimization\n- **Archive creation**: Store web content in more compact, preservation-friendly formats\n- **Accessibility**: Convert content to formats that work better with screen readers\n\nThis tutorial covers both converting existing HTML files and combining web crawling with HTML-to-text conversion in a single workflow -- all using the command line.\n\n### defuddle-cli\n\n[defuddle-cli](https://github.com/defuddle/defuddle) specializes in HTML - Markdown conversion. It's a bit slow and not very customizable but produces clean Markdown that preserves structure, links, and basic formatting. Best for content where preserving the document structure is important.\n\n```bash\nfind . -name '*.html' -exec npx --package defuddle-cli -y defuddle parse {} --md -o {}.md \\;\n```\n\n- `find . -name '*.html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n- `-exec ... \\;`: Executes the following command for each file found\n- `npx --package defuddle-cli -y`: Installs and runs defuddle-cli without prompting\n- `defuddle parse {} --md`: Parses the HTML file (represented by `{}`) and converts to markdown\n- `-o {}.md`: Outputs to a file with the original name plus .md extension\n\n### Pandoc\n\n[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is a bit slow and highly customizable, preserving almost all formatting elements, leading to verbose markdown. Best for academic or documentation conversion where precision matters.\n\nPandoc can convert from many other formats (such as Word, PDF, LaTeX, etc.) to Markdown and vice versa, making it one of most popular and versatele document convertors.\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"How to Convert a Word Document to Markdown for Free using Pandoc (12 min)\" describes an educational image likely depicting a tutorial or guide on converting Microsoft Word (.doc or .docx) files to Markdown (.md) files using the Pandoc software.  The image probably shows a step-by-step process, possibly including:\n\n* **Visual Elements:** Screenshots of a Word document and a Markdown file side-by-side, highlighting the differences in formatting.  There might be screenshots of the Pandoc command line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI) if one exists, showing the conversion command or process.  The image may include numbered steps or arrows pointing to specific elements within the screenshots.  Perhaps there's a visual representation of the file conversion process, perhaps a flow chart or diagram.\n\n* **Textual Elements:** The image may contain concise instructions or explanations accompanying the screenshots.  It could include the exact Pandoc command used for the conversion, specifying the input and output file names.  Important aspects like handling images, tables, and formatting during the conversion might also be highlighted.  The \"12 min\" in the alt text suggests a time estimate for completing the conversion process.\n\n* **Overall Impression:** The image aims to provide a quick, visual guide to using Pandoc, emphasizing its free and easy-to-use nature for converting Word documents to the simpler, plain-text Markdown format.  The student would likely learn the basic steps involved and understand the visual differences between Word and Markdown files.  The image is targeted at users with some basic computer literacy, comfortable with using the command line or a simple graphical interface.]](https://youtu.be/HPSK7q13-40)\n\n```bash\nfind . -name '*.html' -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown_strict -o {}.md {} \\;\n```\n\n- `find . -name '*.html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n- `-exec ... \\;`: Executes the following command for each file found\n- `pandoc`: The Swiss Army knife of document conversion\n- `-f html -t markdown_strict`: Convert from HTML format to strict markdown\n- `-o {}.md {}`: Output to a markdown file, with the input file as the last argument\n\n### Lynx\n\n[Lynx](https://lynx.invisible-island.net/) is fast and generates text (not Markdown) with minimal formatting. Lynx renders the HTML as it would appear in a text browser, preserving basic structure but losing complex formatting. Best for quick content extraction or when processing large numbers of files.\n\n```bash\nfind . -type f -name '*.html' -exec sh -c 'for f; do lynx -dump -nolist \"$f\" > \"${f%.html}.txt\"; done' _ {} +\n```\n\n- `find . -type f -name '*.html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n- `-exec sh -c '...' _ {} +`: Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency\n- `for f; do ... done`: Loops through each file in the batch\n- `lynx -dump -nolist \"$f\"`: Uses the lynx text browser to render HTML as plain text\n  - `-dump`: Output the rendered page to stdout\n  - `-nolist`: Don't include the list of links at the end\n- `> \"${f%.html}.txt\"`: Save output to a .txt file with the same base name\n\n### w3m\n\n[w3m](https://w3m.sourceforge.net/) is very slow processing with minimal formatting. w3m tends to be more thorough in its rendering than lynx but takes considerably longer. It supports basic JavaScript processing, making it better at handling modern websites with dynamic content. Best for cases where you need slightly better rendering than lynx, particularly for complex layouts and tables, and when some JavaScript processing is beneficial.\n\n```bash\nfind . -type f -name '*.html' \\\n  -exec sh -c 'for f; do \\\n      w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph \"$f\" > \"${f%.html}.md\"; \\\n    done' _ {} +\n```\n\n- `find . -type f -name '*.html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n- `-exec sh -c '...' _ {} +`: Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency\n- `for f; do ... done`: Loops through each file in the batch\n- `w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph \"$f\"`: Uses the w3m text browser to render HTML\n  - `-dump`: Output the rendered page to stdout\n  - `-T text/html`: Specify input format as HTML\n  - `-cols 80`: Set output width to 80 columns\n  - `-no-graph`: Don't show graphic characters for tables and frames\n- `> \"${f%.html}.md\"`: Save output to a .md file with the same base name\n\n### Comparison\n\n| Approach     | Speed     | Format Quality | Preservation                       | Best For                        |\n| ------------ | --------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| defuddle-cli | Slow      | High           | Good structure and links           | Content migration, publishing   |\n| pandoc       | Slow      | Very High      | Almost everything                  | Academic papers, documentation  |\n| lynx         | Fast      | Low            | Basic structure only               | Quick extraction, large batches |\n| w3m          | Very Slow | Medium-Low     | Basic structure with better tables | Improved readability over lynx  |\n\n### Optimize Batch Processing\n\n1. **Process in parallel**: Use GNU Parallel for multi-core processing:\n\n   ```bash\n   find . -name \"*.html\" | parallel \"pandoc -f html -t markdown_strict -o {}.md {}\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Filter files before processing**:\n\n   ```bash\n   find . -name \"*.html\" -type f -size -1M -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown {} -o {}.md \\;\n   ```\n\n3. **Customize output format** with additional parameters:\n\n   ```bash\n   # For pandoc, preserve line breaks but simplify other formatting\n   find . -name \"*.html\" -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown --wrap=preserve --atx-headers {} -o {}.md \\;\n   ```\n\n4. **Handle errors gracefully**:\n\n   ```bash\n   find . -name \"*.html\" -exec sh -c 'for f; do pandoc -f html -t markdown \"$f\" -o \"${f%.html}.md\" 2>/dev/null || echo \"Failed: $f\" >> conversion_errors.log; done' _ {} +\n   ```\n\n### Choosing the Right Tool\n\n- **Need speed with minimal formatting?** Use the lynx approach\n- **Need precise, complete conversion?** Use pandoc\n- **Need a balance of structure and cleanliness?** Try defuddle-cli\n- **Working with complex tables?** w3m might render them better\n\nRemember that the best approach depends on your specific use case, volume of files, and how you intend to use the converted text.\n\n### Combined Crawling and Conversion\n\nSometimes you need to both crawl a website and convert its content to markdown or text in a single workflow, like [Crawl4AI](#crawl4ai) or [markdown-crawler](#markdown-crawler).\n\n1. **For research/data collection**: Use a specialized crawler (like Crawl4AI) with post-processing conversion\n2. **For simple website archiving**: Markdown-crawler provides a convenient all-in-one solution\n3. **For high-quality conversion**: Use wget/wget2 for crawling followed by pandoc for conversion\n4. **For maximum speed**: Combine wget with lynx in a pipeline\n\n### Crawl4AI\n\n[Crawl4AI](https://github.com/crawl4ai/crawl4ai) is designed for single-page extraction with high-quality content processing. Crawl4AI is optimized for AI training data extraction, focusing on clean, structured content rather than complete site preservation. It excels at removing boilerplate content and preserving the main article text.\n\n```bash\nuv venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate.fish\nuv pip install crawl4ai\ncrawl4ai-setup\n```\n\n- `uv venv`: Creates a Python virtual environment using uv (a faster alternative to virtualenv)\n- `source .venv/bin/activate.fish`: Activates the virtual environment (fish shell syntax)\n- `uv pip install crawl4ai`: Installs the crawl4ai package\n- `crawl4ai-setup`: Initializes crawl4ai's required dependencies\n\n### markdown-crawler\n\n[markdown-crawler](https://pypi.org/project/markdown-crawler/) combines web crawling with markdown conversion in one tool. It's efficient for bulk processing but tends to produce lower-quality markdown conversion compared to specialized converters like pandoc or defuddle. Best for projects where quantity and integration are more important than perfect formatting.\n\n```bash\nuv venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate.fish\nuv pip install markdown-crawler\nmarkdown-crawler -t 5 -d 3 -b ./markdown https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/\n```\n\n- `uv venv` and activation: Same as above\n- `uv pip install markdown-crawler`: Installs the markdown-crawler package\n- `markdown-crawler`: Runs the crawler with these options:\n  - `-t 5`: Sets 5 threads for parallel crawling\n  - `-d 3`: Limits crawl depth to 3 levels\n  - `-b ./markdown`: Sets the base output directory\n  - Final argument is the starting URL\n",

    "content": "## Converting PDFs to Markdown\n\nPDF documents are ubiquitous in academic, business, and technical contexts, but extracting and repurposing their content can be challenging. This tutorial explores various command-line tools for converting PDFs to Markdown format, with a focus on preserving structure and formatting suitable for different use cases, including preparation for Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\nUse Cases:\n\n- **LLM training and fine-tuning**: Create clean text data from PDFs for AI model training\n- **Knowledge base creation**: Transform PDFs into searchable, editable markdown documents\n- **Content repurposing**: Convert academic papers and reports for web publication\n- **Data extraction**: Pull structured content from PDF documents for analysis\n- **Accessibility**: Convert PDFs to more accessible formats for screen readers\n- **Citation and reference management**: Extract bibliographic information from academic papers\n- **Documentation conversion**: Transform technical PDFs into maintainable documentation\n\n### PyMuPDF4LLM\n\n[PyMuPDF4LLM](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pymupdf4llm/) is a specialized component of the PyMuPDF library that generates Markdown specifically formatted for Large Language Models. It produces high-quality markdown with good preservation of document structure. It's specifically optimized for producing text that works well with LLMs, removing irrelevant formatting while preserving semantic structure. Requires PyTorch, which adds dependencies but enables more advanced processing capabilities.\n\nPyMuPDF4LLM uses [MuPDF](https://mupdf.com/) as its PDF parsing engine. [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/) is emerging as a strong default for PDF text extraction due to its accuracy and performance in handling complex PDF structures.\n\n```bash\nPYTHONUTF8=1 uv run --with pymupdf4llm python -c 'import pymupdf4llm; h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\"); h.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\"))'\n```\n\n- `PYTHONUTF8=1`: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding regardless of system locale\n- `uv run --with pymupdf4llm`: Uses uv package manager to run Python with the pymupdf4llm package\n- `python -c '...'`: Executes Python code directly from the command line\n- `import pymupdf4llm`: Imports the PDF-to-Markdown module\n- `h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\")`: Creates a file to write the markdown output\n- `h.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\"))`: Converts the PDF to markdown and writes to file\n\n## Markitdown\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"Microsoft MarkItDown - Convert Files and Office Documents to Markdown - Install Locally (9 min)\" describes an educational image likely showing a tutorial or guide on using a software called \"Microsoft MarkItDown.\"  The image probably illustrates a step-by-step process, potentially with screenshots, to convert files (like Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, etc.) into the Markdown file format. The \"(9 min)\" indicates the estimated time to complete the tutorial or process.\n\nFor students, this image suggests a helpful resource for:\n\n* **Learning about Markdown:** The image implies an introduction to Markdown, a lightweight markup language commonly used for writing web content.\n* **Improving workflow:**  Converting files to Markdown can streamline workflows, especially for students who need to create documents for websites, blogs, or online platforms that accept Markdown.\n* **Understanding file conversion:** The image demonstrates a practical application of file conversion, a valuable skill in various academic and professional contexts.\n* **Local installation:** The phrase \"Install Locally\" indicates that the software is installed directly on a computer, rather than used through a web browser.  This might be relevant for students concerned about internet connectivity or data security.\n\nThe image itself might contain elements like:\n\n* **Screenshots of the Microsoft MarkItDown interface:** Showing menus, buttons, and windows involved in the conversion process.\n* **Numbered steps or bullet points:** Guiding the user through the installation and conversion procedure.\n* **Visual cues:** Arrows, highlights, or callouts to emphasize important parts of the process.\n* **File examples:** Showing before-and-after examples of files in their original format and converted to Markdown.\n\n\nIn short, the image promises a concise (9-minute) guide to using a tool that simplifies the conversion of common file types into Markdown, a useful skill for students working with digital content.]](https://youtu.be/v65Oyddfxeg)\n\n[Markitdown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown) is Microsoft's tool for converting various document formats to Markdown, including PDFs, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and ZIP files. It's a versatile multi-format converter that handles PDFs via PDFMiner, DOCX via Mammoth, XLSX via Pandas, and PPTX via Python-PPTX. Good for batch processing of mixed document types. The quality of PDF conversion is generally good but may struggle with complex layouts or heavily formatted documents.\n\n```bash\nPYTHONUTF8=1 uvx markitdown $FILE.pdf > markitdown.md\n```\n\n- `PYTHONUTF8=1`: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding\n- `uvx markitdown`: Runs the markitdown tool via the uv package manager\n- `$FILE.pdf`: The input PDF file\n- `> markitdown.md`: Redirects output to a markdown file\n\n### Unstructured\n\n[Unstructured](https://unstructured.io/) is rapidly becoming the de facto library for parsing over 40 different file types. It is excellent for extracting text and tables from diverse document formats. Particularly useful for generating clean content to pass to LLMs. Strong community support and actively maintained.\n\n## GROBID\n\nIf you specifically need to parse references from text-native PDFs or reliably OCR'ed ones, [GROBID](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid) remains the de facto choice. It excels at extracting structured bibliographic information with high accuracy.\n\n```bash\n# Start GROBID service\ndocker run -t --rm -p 8070:8070 lfoppiano/grobid:0.7.2\n\n# Process PDF with curl\ncurl -X POST -F \"input=@paper.pdf\" localhost:8070/api/processFulltextDocument > references.tei.xml\n```\n\n### Mistral OCR API\n\n[Mistral OCR](https://mistral.ai/products/ocr/) offers an end-to-end cloud API that preserves both text and layout, making it easier to isolate specific sections like References. It shows the most promise currently, though it requires post-processing.\n\n## Azure Document Intelligence API\n\nFor enterprise users already in the Microsoft ecosystem, [Azure Document Intelligence](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/document-intelligence) provides excellent raw OCR with enterprise SLAs. May require custom model training or post-processing to match GROBID's reference extraction capabilities.\n\n### Other libraries\n\n[Docling](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling) is IBM's document understanding library that supports PDF conversion. It can be challenging to install, particularly on Windows and some Linux distributions. Offers advanced document understanding capabilities beyond simple text extraction.\n\n[MegaParse](https://github.com/QuivrHQ/MegaParse) takes a comprehensive approach using LibreOffice, Pandoc, Tesseract OCR, and other tools. It has Robust handling of different document types but requires an OpenAI API key for some features. Good for complex documents but has significant dependencies.\n\n## Comparison of PDF-to-Markdown Tools\n\n| Tool         | Strengths                                | Weaknesses                   | Best For                             |\n| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |\n| PyMuPDF4LLM  | Structure preservation, LLM optimization | Requires PyTorch             | AI training data, semantic structure |\n| Markitdown   | Multi-format support, simple usage       | Less precise layout handling | Batch processing, mixed documents    |\n| Unstructured | Wide format support, active development  | Can be resource-intensive    | Production pipelines, integration    |\n| GROBID       | Reference extraction excellence          | Narrower use case            | Academic papers, citations           |\n| Docling      | Advanced document understanding          | Installation difficulties    | Research applications                |\n| MegaParse    | Comprehensive approach                   | Requires OpenAI API          | Complex documents, OCR needs         |\n\nHow to pick:\n\n- **Need LLM-ready content?** PyMuPDF4LLM is specifically designed for this\n- **Working with multiple document formats?** Markitdown handles diverse inputs\n- **Extracting academic references?** GROBID remains the standard\n- **Building a production pipeline?** Unstructured offers the best integration options\n- **Handling complex layouts?** Consider commercial OCR like Mistral or Azure Document Intelligence\n\nThe optimal approach depends on your specific requirements regarding accuracy, structure preservation, and the intended use of the extracted content.\n\n## Tips for Optimal PDF Conversion\n\n1. **Pre-process PDFs** when possible:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Optimize a PDF for text extraction first\n   ocrmypdf --optimize 3 --skip-text input.pdf optimized.pdf\n   ```\n\n2. **Try multiple tools** on the same document to compare results:\n\n3. **Handle scanned PDFs** appropriately:\n\n   ```bash\n   # For scanned documents, run OCR first\n   ocrmypdf --force-ocr input.pdf ocr_ready.pdf\n   PYTHONUTF8=1 uvx markitdown ocr_ready.pdf > markitdown.md\n   ```\n\n4. **Consider post-processing** for better results:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Simple post-processing example\n   sed -i 's/\\([A-Z]\\)\\./\\1\\.\\n/g' output.md  # Add line breaks after sentences\n   ```\n",

    "content": "## Correlation with Excel\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"Correlation with Excel\" indicates an image showing how to calculate or visualize correlation using Microsoft Excel.  To describe it effectively for student assistance, we need to imagine the contents.  Several possibilities exist:\n\n**Possible Image Contents & Descriptions:**\n\n* **Scatter Plot with Trendline:** The image likely shows a scatter plot generated in Excel.  Data points are plotted, representing two variables (e.g., height and weight). A trendline (linear regression line) is overlaid, showing the general direction of the relationship. The R-squared value (or correlation coefficient 'r') might be displayed, quantifying the strength and direction of the linear correlation.  The description should explain how to create a scatter plot in Excel, add a trendline, and interpret the R-squared value (or 'r'). Mention that a positive slope indicates a positive correlation, a negative slope indicates a negative correlation, and an R-squared close to 1 indicates a strong correlation.\n\n\n* **Correlation Formula in Excel Cell:** The image could display an Excel spreadsheet with a cell containing the `CORREL` function, showing its syntax and arguments (e.g., `=CORREL(array1, array2)`).  The description should explain the function's purpose, how to use it correctly by selecting the appropriate data ranges (array1 and array2), and what the resulting correlation coefficient means (range from -1 to +1, interpretation of positive/negative/zero correlation).\n\n\n* **Step-by-Step Instructions:** The image might consist of a series of screenshots illustrating a step-by-step process of calculating correlation in Excel.  Each step would have a caption or short description. The description for students should follow this step-by-step guide, reinforcing each action and its purpose.\n\n\n* **Comparison of Correlation Methods:**  It might show different ways to assess correlation, perhaps comparing visual methods (scatter plot) with the `CORREL` function.  The description would need to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and when each is most appropriate.\n\n\n**General Description for Student Assistance (adaptable to the specific image):**\n\n\"This image demonstrates how to calculate and interpret correlation using Microsoft Excel. [Specifically, it shows a/an (scatter plot, Excel formula, step-by-step guide, comparison of methods)].  Correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.  A correlation coefficient, typically denoted as 'r' or presented as an R-squared value, ranges from -1 to +1.  A value of +1 indicates a perfect positive correlation (as one variable increases, the other increases), -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation (as one increases, the other decreases), and 0 indicates no linear correlation. [Add specific details relevant to the image content:  e.g., 'The image shows how to use the `CORREL` function in Excel to obtain the correlation coefficient', or 'The scatter plot visualizes the relationship between [variable 1] and [variable 2], and the trendline shows the best-fit linear relationship'].

    "content": "## CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing\n\nCORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security mechanism that controls how web browsers handle requests between different origins (domains, protocols, or ports). Data scientists need CORS for APIs serving data or analysis to a browser on a different domain.\n\nWatch this practical explanation of CORS (3 min):\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"CORS in 100 Seconds\" suggests an image designed to quickly explain the concept of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).  Without seeing the image itself, I can only speculate on its content, but a likely depiction would include the following elements to explain CORS within a short timeframe:\n\n* **A visual representation of two origins:** This could be two distinct boxes or domains labeled \"Origin A\" and \"Origin B,\" representing different websites or servers.  Arrows might show attempts to access resources.\n\n* **A depiction of a request:** An arrow from \"Origin A\" pointing to \"Origin B\" labeled \"Request\" might indicate a browser trying to fetch data (e.g., an image, JSON data) from a different domain.\n\n* **A depiction of the CORS mechanism:**  This could be a security guard or a gate between the two origins, representing the browser's security checks and the server's response.  There might be labels indicating the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header and other relevant CORS headers.\n\n* **Success and failure scenarios:**  Separate sections might show a successful request (with the data successfully transferred, perhaps a green checkmark) and a failed request (showing a red \"X\" or an error message indicating a CORS error), visually illustrating the conditions under which a request is allowed or blocked.\n\n* **Simplified code snippets:** Small snippets of code showing the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in a server response might be included to illustrate its practical implementation.  This might be in a language like JavaScript or in pseudo-code.\n\n* **Key terms:** Important terms like \"Origin,\" \"Browser,\" \"Server,\" \"Request,\" \"Response,\" and \"CORS policy\" could be clearly labeled within the image to aid comprehension.\n\n* **A timeline or flowchart:** The image might use a timeline or flowchart to show the sequence of events in a CORS request, from the browser initiating the request to the server responding.\n\nIn short, the image is likely a simplified, visually engaging infographic designed to quickly introduce the core concepts of CORS and its implications for web security and cross-domain communication.  The \"100 Seconds\" in the alt text emphasizes its concise and easily digestible nature.]](https://youtu.be/4KHiSt0oLJ0)\n\nKey CORS concepts:\n\n- **Same-Origin Policy**: Browsers block requests between different origins by default\n- **CORS Headers**: Server responses must include specific headers to allow cross-origin requests\n- **Preflight Requests**: Browsers send OPTIONS requests to check if the actual request is allowed\n- **Credentials**: Special handling required for requests with cookies or authentication\n\nIf you're exposing your API with a GET request publicly, the only thing you need to do is set the HTTP header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.\n\nHere are other common CORS headers:\n\n```http\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\n```\n\nTo implement CORS in FastAPI, use the [`CORSMiddleware` middleware](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/cors/):\n\n```python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\nfrom fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\napp.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware, allow_origins=[\"*\"]) # Allow GET requests from all origins\n# Or, provide more granular control:\napp.add_middleware(\n    CORSMiddleware,\n    allow_origins=[\"https://example.com\"],  # Allow a specific domain\n    allow_credentials=True,  # Allow cookies\n    allow_methods=[\"GET\", \"POST\", \"PUT\", \"DELETE\"],  # Allow specific methods\n    allow_headers=[\"*\"],  # Allow all headers\n)\n```\n\nTesting CORS with JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\n// Simple request\nconst response = await fetch(\"https://api.example.com/data\", {\n  method: \"GET\",\n  headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n});\n\n// Request with credentials\nconst response = await fetch(\"https://api.example.com/data\", {\n  credentials: \"include\",\n  headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n});\n```\n\nUseful CORS debugging tools:\n\n- [CORS Checker](https://cors-test.codehappy.dev/): Test CORS configurations\n- Browser DevTools Network tab: Inspect CORS headers and preflight requests\n- [cors-anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere): CORS proxy for development\n\nCommon CORS errors and solutions:\n\n- `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header`: Configure server to send proper CORS headers\n- `Request header field not allowed`: Add required headers to `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`\n- `Credentials flag`: Set both `credentials: 'include'` and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`\n- `Wild card error`: Cannot use `*` with credentials; specify exact origins\n",

    "content": "## Crawling with the CLI\n\nSince websites are a common source of data, we often download entire websites (crawling) and then process them offline.\n\nWeb crawling is essential in many data-driven scenarios:\n\n- **Data mining and analysis**: Gathering structured data from multiple pages for market research, competitive analysis, or academic research\n- **Content archiving**: Creating offline copies of websites for preservation or backup purposes\n- **SEO analysis**: Analyzing site structure, metadata, and content to improve search rankings\n- **Legal compliance**: Capturing website content for regulatory or compliance documentation\n- **Website migration**: Creating a complete copy before moving to a new platform or design\n- **Offline access**: Downloading educational resources, documentation, or reference materials for use without internet connection\n\nThe most commonly used tool for fetching websites is [`wget`](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/). It is pre-installed in many UNIX distributions and easy to install.\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"Scraping Websites using Wget (8 min)\" indicates an educational image likely depicting a tutorial or lesson on web scraping using the Wget command-line tool.  The image probably shows:\n\n* **Visual elements related to web scraping:** This could include screenshots of a terminal window showing Wget commands being typed and executed, perhaps with successful downloads indicated.  There might be visual representations of a website's structure (maybe a simplified sitemap) to show what data is being targeted.  The image may also depict the downloaded files (HTML, images, etc.) organized in a file directory.\n\n* **Wget commands:**  The image will almost certainly highlight key Wget commands relevant to web scraping, possibly with annotations explaining their function.  These commands might include options for recursive downloading, specifying file types to download, or setting limits on the depth of the scraping.\n\n* **Time estimate:** The \"(8 min)\" suggests the tutorial or lesson segment depicted in the image takes approximately eight minutes to complete. This implies a concise, focused explanation of a specific aspect of web scraping with Wget.\n\n\nFor student assistance, the image would best serve as a visual aid alongside a written explanation.

    "content": "## Data Aggregation in Excel\n\n[[Image Description: The image titled \"Data Aggregation in Excel\" likely shows a process or example of how to consolidate and summarize data from multiple sources within an Excel spreadsheet.  It could visually demonstrate several key aspects of data aggregation:\n\n* **Source Data:** The image probably displays several separate data tables or ranges, each representing a different source (e.g., sales data from different regions, survey responses from different demographics).  These tables will likely have common columns representing the data points to be aggregated (e.g., \"Region,\" \"Product,\" \"Sales\").  The data within these tables would be distinct.\n\n* **Aggregation Function:**  The image might highlight the use of a specific Excel function, such as `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`, or others, to perform the aggregation. This might be shown through a formula in a cell, or visually indicated via a legend or annotation.  The specific function used will depend on the type of aggregation being performed (e.g., summing total sales, finding average customer ratings, counting the number of responses).\n\n* **Consolidated Data:** A key part of the image would show a resulting, single table or summary which contains the aggregated data.  This table would likely have fewer rows than the source tables, but it would retain the common columns and show the aggregated values calculated using the chosen function. For example, if summing sales, this table would show total sales per region or per product across all source tables.\n\n* **PivotTables (Possibly):**  The image might showcase a PivotTable, a powerful Excel tool specifically designed for data aggregation and summarization. A PivotTable would allow for flexible aggregation and the ability to rearrange and filter the aggregated data easily.\n\n* **Visual Representations (Possibly):** The image might include charts or graphs based on the aggregated data to visually represent the summarized information, aiding in data interpretation and understanding.\n\nIn summary, the image should provide a clear, step-by-step (or at least illustrative) guide on how to bring together data from multiple sources within Excel and then summarize it into a meaningful and concise representation.

Below are common cleaning tasks using the DuckDB CLI.\n\n### Create a Sample Dataset\n\nLet's create a sample dataset that mimics real business data patterns - incomplete customer records, time-series orders, and regional variations. Before working with messy production data, you need a controlled environment to test data cleaning techniques. This sample represents common e-commerce scenarios: missing customer info (20% of orders), seasonal patterns (15-day cycles), and geographic segmentation that drive business decisions like inventory placement and marketing campaigns.\n\n```bash\nduckdb sample.duckdb <<'SQL'\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE orders AS\nSELECT\n  seq AS order_id,\n  CASE WHEN seq % 5 = 0 THEN NULL ELSE 'Customer ' || seq END AS customer,\n  date '2025-01-01' + CAST(seq % 15 AS INTEGER) AS order_date,\n  CASE WHEN seq % 3 = 0 THEN 'Widget ' || seq ELSE 'Gadget ' || seq END AS product,\n  round(random()*1000, 2) AS amount,\n  CASE WHEN seq % 4 = 0 THEN 'EU' ELSE 'US' END AS region\nFROM range(1, 50) tbl(seq);\nSQL\n```\n\n### Create a Messy CSV\n\nLet's also simulate real-world data export issues - unescaped quotes, missing delimiters, and malformed records that break standard CSV parsers. Data rarely arrives clean. Export systems fail, manual data entry introduces errors, and third-party integrations send malformed files. Learning to handle corrupted CSV files prevents hours of debugging and ensures your data pipeline doesn't break when inevitably receiving bad data from vendors, APIs, or legacy systems.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > messy_orders.csv\norder_id,customer,order_date,product,amount,region\n1,Customer 1,2025-01-01,Widget 1,100,US\n\"2,Customer 2,2025-01-02,Gadget 2,200,US\n3,Customer 3,2025-01-03,Gadget 3,300,EU\nEOF\n```\n\n### Create a Big CSV\n\nNext, we'll create a large dataset to practice memory-efficient processing techniques that handle files too big to fit in RAM. When working with millions of customer records, transaction logs, or sensor data, traditional tools crash or run out of memory. DuckDB's streaming capabilities let you process 100GB+ files on laptops by reading data in chunks, making big data analysis accessible without expensive infrastructure.\n\n```bash\nduckdb sample.duckdb <<'SQL'\nCOPY (SELECT seq AS id, random() AS val FROM range(100000)) TO 'big.csv';\nSQL\n```\n\n### Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nWe need to examine our data structure and quality before making business decisions. Every data analysis starts with understanding what you have - missing values can skew customer segmentation, outliers affect revenue forecasting, and data types determine which analytical techniques work. Quick EDA prevents costly mistakes like launching marketing campaigns based on incomplete customer data or setting prices using corrupted transaction amounts.\n\n```sql\n-- Preview and get stats\nSELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 5;\nDESCRIBE orders;\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS n, AVG(amount) AS avg_amount FROM orders;\n```\n\n### Converting Data to Other Formats\n\nLet's export cleaned data to formats optimized for different business needs. Analytics teams need Parquet for fast querying, APIs require JSON for web integration, and executives want CSV for Excel compatibility. Format conversion ensures your cleaned data reaches every stakeholder in their preferred format, enabling faster decision-making across departments without forcing everyone to learn SQL.\n\n```sql\nCOPY (SELECT * FROM orders) TO 'orders.json' (FORMAT JSON);\nCOPY (SELECT * FROM orders) TO 'orders.parquet' (FORMAT PARQUET);\n```\n\n### Reading Messy CSV\n\nWe need to handle corrupted files that would normally crash your data pipeline. Real-world CSV files from vendors, legacy systems, or manual exports often contain malformed rows that break standard parsers. Instead of spending hours manually fixing files or losing critical business data, DuckDB's error handling lets you salvage usable records while identifying problem areas for follow-up with data providers.\n\n```sql\n-- Skip bad lines while loading\nSELECT *\nFROM read_csv_auto('messy_orders.csv', ignore_errors=true);\n```\n\n### Handling Missing Values\n\nIt's important to address incomplete data that could lead to wrong business conclusions. Missing customer names prevent personalized marketing, absent transaction amounts skew revenue calculations, and incomplete addresses block shipping. Rather than excluding entire records and losing valuable information, strategic imputation preserves data for analysis while clearly marking assumptions made during the cleaning process.\n\n```sql\n-- Replace null customer names\nSELECT COALESCE(customer, 'Unknown') AS customer FROM orders;\n```\n\n### String Operations\n\nIt's common to standardize text data that comes from multiple sources with inconsistent formatting. Product names from different suppliers use varying cases, customer entries have extra spaces, and imported data contains mixed formatting. Clean, consistent strings enable accurate grouping for inventory management, prevent duplicate customer records, and ensure search functionality works properly across your application.\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT TRIM(LOWER(product)) AS clean_product FROM orders;\n```\n\n### Date Parsing and Conversion\n\nTypically, we transform dates into different formats that enable time-based business analysis. Raw date strings from different systems use various formats that prevent proper sorting and filtering. Converting to standard formats enables monthly sales reporting, seasonal trend analysis, and time-based customer segmentation - critical for inventory planning, marketing campaigns, and financial forecasting.\n\n```sql\nSELECT order_id, STRFTIME(order_date, '%Y-%m') AS order_month FROM orders;\n```\n\n### Conditional Logic and Binning\n\nA common task is to categorize continuous data into meaningful business segments that drive decision-making. Converting exact dollar amounts into price tiers enables targeted marketing (premium vs budget customers), inventory classification (high/medium/low value items), and commission structures. This segmentation forms the foundation for personalized pricing, customer targeting, and performance analysis.\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n  order_id,\n  CASE WHEN amount > 700 THEN 'high' WHEN amount > 300 THEN 'medium' ELSE 'low' END AS price_band\nFROM orders;\n```\n\n### Regex Search and Replace\n\nWe often need to clean complex text patterns that simple string operations can't handle. Product descriptions contain multiple spaces, phone numbers have inconsistent formatting, and addresses mix abbreviations with full words. Regular expressions fix these patterns systematically, ensuring consistent data quality for customer communications, shipping integrations, and search functionality.\n\n```sql\nSELECT REGEXP_REPLACE(product, '\\\\s+', ' ', 'g') AS tidy_product FROM orders;\n```\n\n### Working with Multiple Formats\n\nLet's combine data from different sources that use various file formats. Modern businesses receive data as CSV exports, JSON from APIs, and Parquet from data warehouses. Rather than maintaining separate processing pipelines, DuckDB's format flexibility lets you join orders from your CSV exports with customer data from JSON APIs and inventory levels from Parquet files in a single query.\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE json_orders AS SELECT * FROM read_json_auto('orders.json');\nCREATE TABLE parquet_orders AS SELECT * FROM read_parquet('orders.parquet');\nSELECT * FROM orders UNION ALL SELECT * FROM parquet_orders;\n```\n\n### Processing in Chunks\n\nWe handle massive datasets that exceed available memory by processing them in manageable segments. When analyzing years of transaction logs, customer behavior data, or sensor readings, loading everything at once crashes systems. Chunk processing enables analysis of terabyte-scale datasets on standard hardware, making enterprise-level data analysis accessible for fraud detection, customer lifetime value calculations, and operational analytics.\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('big.csv') LIMIT 1000 OFFSET 0;\nSELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('big.csv') LIMIT 1000 OFFSET 1000;\n```\n\n### Filtering Rows and Dropping Columns\n\nWe'll focus analysis on relevant data subsets while removing sensitive or unnecessary information. Business analysis rarely needs all data - marketing teams want current customers, finance needs profitable regions, and product managers focus on active items. Efficient filtering reduces processing time, protects sensitive data (removing PII columns), and ensures analysis focuses on business-relevant subsets rather than getting lost in comprehensive but unfocused datasets.\n\n```sql\nSELECT order_id, amount FROM orders WHERE region = 'US';\nSELECT * EXCLUDE region FROM orders;\n```\n\n### Derived Columns\n\nNow, let's create new business metrics from existing data that drive key performance indicators. Raw transaction amounts become profit margins with tax calculations, customer regions enable territory-based analysis, and dates support seasonal comparisons. These derived metrics power executive dashboards, sales team performance tracking, and automated business rules without requiring manual calculations or separate reporting tools.\n\n```sql\nSELECT *, amount * 0.1 AS tax, UPPER(region) AS region_code FROM orders;\n```\n\n### Summaries and Pivots\n\nA big part of data preparation is to transform detailed transaction data into executive-level insights that inform strategic decisions. Converting thousands of individual orders into regional sales summaries, customer segment performance, and product category trends enables quick identification of growth opportunities, underperforming markets, and inventory optimization needs. These aggregations become the foundation for board presentations, budget planning, and strategic initiatives.\n\n```sql\n-- Aggregation\nSELECT region, COUNT(*) AS n_orders, SUM(amount) AS total FROM orders GROUP BY region;\n\n-- Pivot by region\nSELECT *\nFROM orders\nPIVOT(COUNT(*) FOR region IN ('US', 'EU'));\n```\n\nUseful links:\n\n- [DuckDB Documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/)\n- [SQL Functions](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/functions/overview)\n- [DuckDB Extensions](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/overview)\n",

(powers of 1000).\n    Binary prefixes can be used, too: KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on.\n\n    The TIME_STYLE argument can be full-iso, long-iso, iso, locale, or +FORMAT.\n    FORMAT is interpreted like in date(1).  If FORMAT is FORMAT1<newline>FORMAT2,\n    then FORMAT1 applies to non-recent files and FORMAT2 to recent files.\n    TIME_STYLE prefixed with 'posix-' takes effect only outside the POSIX locale.\n    Also the TIME_STYLE environment variable sets the default style to use.\n\n    Using color to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and\n    with --color=never.  With --color=auto, ls emits color codes only when\n    standard output is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS environment\n    variable can change the settings.  Use the dircolors command to set it.\n\n    Exit status:\n     0  if OK,\n     1  if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),\n     2  if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).\n\n    GNU coreutils online help: <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/>\n    Full documentation <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/ls>\n    or available locally via: info '(coreutils) ls invocation'\n\n```python\n# By default, it just lists all file names\n!ls\n```\n\n    sample_data  s-anand.net-Apr-2024.gz\n\n```python\n# If we want to see the size of the file, use `-l` for the long-listing format\n!ls -l\n```\n\n    total 5672\n    drwxr-xr-x 1 root root    4096 Jun  6 14:21 sample_data\n    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 5801198 Jun  9 05:18 s-anand.net-Apr-2024.gz\n\n## Uncompress the log file\n\n`gzip` is the most popular compression format on the web. It's fast and pretty good. (`xz` is much better but slower.)\n\nSince the file has a `.gz` extension, we know it's compressed using `gzip`. We can use `gzip -d FILE.gz` to decompress the file. It'll replace `FILE.gz` with `FILE`.\n\n(Compression works the opposite way. `gzip FILE` replaces `FILE` with `FILE.gz`)[link text](https://)\n\n```python\n# gzip -d is the same as gunzip. They both decompress a GZIP-ed file\n!gzip -d s-anand.net-Apr-2024.gz\n```\n\n```python\n# Let's list the files and see the size\n!ls -l\n```\n\n    total 50832\n    drwxr-xr-x 1 root root     4096 Jun  6 14:21 sample_data\n    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 52044491 Jun  9 05:18 s-anand.net-Apr-2024\n\nIn this case, a file that was ~5.8MiB became ~52MiB, roughly 10 times larger.

It has a lot of data. Some are clear. For example, taking the last row:\n\n- `37.59.21.100` is the IP address that made a request. That's from [OVH](https://www.whois.com/whois/37.59.21.100) - a French cloud provider. Maybe a bot.\n- `[30/Apr/2024:07:11:31 -0500]` is the time of the request\n- `\"GET /blog/2003-mumbai-bloggers-meet-photos/feed/ HTTP/1.1\"` is the request made to [this page](https://s-anand.net/blog/2003-mumbai-bloggers-meet-photos/feed/)\n- `200` is the HTTP reponse status code, indicating that all's well\n- `686` bytes was the size of the response\n- `\"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/30.0.1599.66 Safari/537.36\"` is the user agent. That's Chrome 30 -- a really old versio of Chrome on Linux. Very likely a bot.\n\n## Count requests\n\n`wc` counts the number of lines, words, and characters in a file. The number of lines is most often used with data.\n\n```python\n!wc s-anand.net-Apr-2024\n```\n\n      208539  4194545 52044491 s-anand.net-Apr-2024\n\nSo, in Apr 2024, there were ~208K requests to the site. Useful to know.\n\nI wonder: **Who is sending most of these requests?**\n\nLet's extract the IP addresses and count them.\n\n## Extract the `IP` column\n\nWe'll use `cut` to cut the first column. It has 2 options that we'll use.\n\n`--delimiter` is the character that splits fields. In the log file, it's a space. (We'll confirm this shortly.)\n`--fields` picks the field to cut. We want field 1 (IP address)\n\nLet's preview this:\n\n```python\n# Preview just the IP addresses from the logs\n!cut --delimiter \" \" --fields 1 s-anand.net-Apr-2024 | head -n 5\n```\n\n    17.241.219.11\n    17.241.75.154\n    101.44.248.120\n    17.241.227.200\n    37.59.21.100\n\nWe used the `|` operator. That passes the output to the next command, `head -n 5`, and gives us first 5 lines. This is called **piping** and is the equivalent of calling a function inside another in programming languages.\n\nWe'll use `sort` to sort these IP addresses. That puts the same IP addresses next to each other.\n\n```python\n# Preview the SORTED IP addresses from the logs\n!cut --delimiter \" \" --fields 1 s-anand.net-Apr-2024 | sort | head -n 5\n```\n\n    100.20.65.50\n    100.43.111.139\n    101.100.145.51\n    101.115.156.11\n    101.115.205.68\n\nThere are no duplicates there... maybe we need to go a bit further?

It uses [Regular Expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions) which are a powerful set of wildcards.\n\n💡 TIP: You **MUST** learn regular expressions. They're very helpful.\n\nHere, we'll search for all lines BEGINNING with 136.243.228.193 and having a space after that. That's `\"^136.243.228.193 \"`.

What are the user agents that DO identify themselves as bots? Let's use `grep` to find all words that match bot.\n\n`grep --only-matching` will show only the matches, not the entire line.\n\nThe regular expression `'\\S*bot\\S*'` (which ChatGPT generated) finds all words that have bot.\n\n- `\\S` matches non-space characters\n- `\\S*` matches 0 or more non-space characters\n\n```python\n# Find all words with `bot` in it\n!grep --only-matching '\\b\\w*bot\\w*\\b' s-anand.net-Apr-2024 | head\n```\n\n    Applebot\n    applebot\n    Applebot\n    applebot\n    Applebot\n    applebot\n    Applebot\n    applebot\n    Applebot\n    applebot\n\n```python\n# Count frequency of all words with `bot` in it and show the top 10\n!grep --only-matching '\\S*bot\\S*' s-anand.net-Apr-2024 | sort | uniq --count | sort --key 1n | tail\n```\n\n       4134 PetalBot;+https://webmaster.petalsearch.com/site/petalbot)\"\n       4307 /robots.txt\n       5664 bingbot/2.0;\n       5664 +http://www.bing.com/bingbot.htm)\n       8771 +claudebot@anthropic.com)\"\n       8827 +http://www.google.com/bot.html)\"\n       8830 Googlebot/2.1;\n      13798 (Applebot/0.1;\n      13798 +http://www.apple.com/go/applebot)\"\n     101262 +https://dataforseo.com/dataforseo-bot)\"\n\nThat gives me a rough sense of who's crawling my site.\n\n1. [DataForSEO](https://dataforseo.com/)\n2. [Apple](https://www.apple.com/)\n3. [Google](https://www.google.com/)\n4. [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)\n5. [Bing](https://www.bing.com/)\n6. [PetalBot](https://aspiegel.com/petalbot)\n\n## Convert logs to CSV\n\nThis file is _almost_ a CSV file separated by spaces instead of commas.\n\nThe main problem is the date. Instead of `[31/Mar/2024:11:27:43 -0500]` it should have been `\"31/Mar/2024:11:27:43 -0500\"`\n\nWe'll use `sed` (stream editor) to replace the characters. `sed` is like `grep` but lets you replace, not just search.\n\n(Actually, `sed` can do a lot more. It's a full-fledged editor. You can insert, delete, edit, etc. programmatically. In fact, `sed` has truly remarkable features that this paragraph is too small to contain.)\n\nThe regular expression we will use is `\\[\\([^]]*\\)\\]`. The way this works is:\n\n- `\\[`: Match the opening square bracket.\n- `\\([^]]*\\)`: Capture everything inside the square brackets (non-greedy match for any character except `]`).\n- `\\]`: Match the closing square bracket.\n\nBTW, I didn't create this. [ChatGPT did](https://chatgpt.com/share/7f14e9d2-15ec-4562-b263-61547d2230f3).\n\n`sed \"s/abc/xyz/\" FILE` replaces `abc` with `xyz` in the file. We can use the regular expression above for the search and `\"\\1\"` for the value -- it inserts captured group enclosed in double quotes.\n\n```python\n# Replace [datetime] etc. with \"datetime\" and save as log.csv\n!sed 's/\\[\\([^]]*\\)\\]/\"\\1\"/' s-anand.net-Apr-2024 > log.csv\n```\n\n```python\n# We should now have a log.csv that's roughly the same size as the original file.\n!ls -l\n```\n\n    total 101660\n    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 52044491 Jun  9 05:19 log.csv\n    drwxr-xr-x 1 root root     4096 Jun  6 14:21 sample_data\n    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 52044491 Jun  9 05:18 s-anand.net-Apr-2024\n\nYou can download this `log.csv` and open it in Excel as a CSV file with space as the delimiter.\n\nBut when I did that, I faced another problem. Some of the lines had extra columns.\n\nThat's because the \"User Agent\" values sometimes contain a quote. CSV files are supposed to escape quotes with `\"\"` -- two double quotes. But Apache uses `\\\"` instead.\n\nI'll leave it as an exercise for you to fix that.\n\n## More commands\n\nWe've covered the commands most often used to process data before analysis.\n\nHere are a few more that you'll find useful.\n\n- `cat` concatenates multiple files. You can join multiple log files with this, for example\n- `awk` is almost a full-fledged programming interface. It's often used for summing up values\n- `less` lets you open and read files, scrolling through it\n\nYou can read the book [Data Science at the Command Line](https://jeroenjanssens.com/dsatcl/) for more tools and examples.\n",

    "content": "# Data Sourcing\n\nBefore you do any kind of data science, you obviously have to get the data to be able to analyze it, visualize it, narrate it, and deploy it.\nAnd what we are going to cover in this module is how you get the data.\n\nThere are three ways you can get the data.\n\n1. The first is you can **download** the data. Either somebody gives you the data and says download it from here, or you are asked to download it from the internet because it's a public data source. But that's the first way—you download the data.\n2. The second way is you can **query it** from somewhere. It may be on a database. It may be available through an API. It may be available through a library. But these are ways in which you can selectively query parts of the data and stitch it together.\n3. The third way is you have to **scrape it**. It's not directly available in a convenient form that you can query or download. But it is, in fact, on a web page. It's available on a PDF file. It's available in a Word document. It's available on an Excel file. It's kind of structured, but you will have to figure out that structure and extract it from there.\n\nIn this module, we will be looking at the tools that will help you either download from a data source or query from an API or from a database or from a library. And finally, how you can scrape from different sources.\n\n[[Image Description: The image, titled \"Data Sourcing - Introduction,\" likely presents a visual explanation of where data comes from and how it's collected.  Without seeing the image itself, I can only speculate on its contents, but here are several possibilities and how they would be described for student assistance:\n\n\n**Possible Image Contents & Descriptions:**\n\n* **A flowchart:** This would show the different stages of data sourcing.  The description could say something like: \"This flowchart illustrates the data sourcing process.  It begins with identifying the need for data (e.g., understanding customer preferences), then moves to selecting data sources (e.g., surveys, databases, social media), followed by data collection methods (e.g., web scraping, APIs, manual entry), and finally data cleaning and preparation.  Each stage is depicted with a box or shape, and arrows show the flow between them.\"\n\n* **A diagram with different data sources:** The image might show icons representing various sources like databases (a grid), spreadsheets (a grid with cells), sensors (a thermometer or similar), social media platforms (logos), surveys (a questionnaire), and more. The description could be: \"This diagram displays various sources of data.  Note the different types available: structured data from databases, unstructured data from social media, and real-time data from sensors. Understanding these different sources is crucial for choosing the right one for your project.\"\n\n* **A world map with data points:**  This visual could show the geographic distribution of data, highlighting areas where data is readily available or scarce.  The description could read: \"The map displays the global distribution of data sources.  Notice the concentration of data in certain regions.  This illustrates the importance of considering geographic factors when sourcing data, particularly if dealing with global datasets.\"\n\n\n* **A combination of the above:**  The image may use a combination of flowcharts, icons, and maps to provide a comprehensive overview of data sourcing.  The description would need to cover all elements, explaining their relationship and relevance to the overall concept.\n\n\n**Regardless of the specific content, a good description for student assistance should also include:**\n\n* **Key terminology:** Define important terms like structured data, unstructured data, primary data, secondary data, data collection methods, and data cleansing.\n* **Examples:**  Provide real-world examples of each data source and how it might be used.\n* **Relevance:** Explain why understanding data sourcing is crucial for data analysis, research, and decision-making.\n\nIn short, a helpful description must accurately reflect the image's content and provide context for students to understand the concept of data sourcing.

Without seeing the image itself, I can only offer possibilities of what it might depict and how a student might use it:\n\n**Possible Image Contents and How to Use Them:**\n\n* **A single image:** This could be a photograph or illustration of a person, place, object, or event.  The student would need to create a story using that image as inspiration.  For example:\n    * **A picture of a mysterious old house:**  The student might invent characters who live there, a spooky event that occurred, or a hidden treasure within.\n    * **A photo of a bustling city street:** The student might create a story about a lost child, a hurried chase, or a chance encounter between strangers.\n    * **An illustration of an unusual creature:** The student would develop a narrative explaining the creature's origins, abilities, and place in the world.\n\n* **A series of images:** A sequence of pictures, like a comic strip without captions, would require the student to narrate the events depicted.  The student would need to infer the characters' emotions, motivations, and the overall plot.\n\n* **An abstract image:** An abstract painting or design could inspire a more metaphorical or symbolic story. The student might interpret colors, shapes, and textures to create a narrative about feelings, dreams, or abstract concepts.\n\n* **A collage of images:**  A collection of disparate pictures could encourage a more complex story with multiple characters, settings, and plotlines interwoven.\n\n**Student Assistance:**\n\nTo best help a student using this image, ask them the following questions:\n\n* **What do you see in the image?**  Describe the details as precisely as possible.  Include colors, shapes, sizes, and any noticeable elements.\n* **Who might be involved in a story based on this image?** Consider characters, their relationships, and their possible motivations.\n* **Where and when might this story take place?**  Think about the setting, time period, and atmosphere.\n* **What could be happening in this image?** Consider possibilities based on the details you observe.\n* **What kind of story could you tell?**  Consider different genres: mystery, adventure, fantasy, romance, science fiction, etc.\n* **What is the main conflict or problem in your story?**  What challenges do the characters face?\n\n\nBy carefully observing the image and answering these questions, the student can develop a compelling and imaginative narrative.  Encourage them to be creative and let their imagination run wild!]](https://youtu.be/aF93i6zVVQg)\n",

To best assist students, we need to imagine several possibilities the image could show, and describe them individually:\n\n**Possible Scenario 1:  A single Excel sheet showing before-and-after transformation.**\n\nThe image might present two sections of the same Excel sheet, clearly demarcated.  One section shows raw, untransformed data, perhaps messy or inconsistently formatted.  This might include:\n\n* **Unorganized data:**  Columns with inconsistent capitalization, leading/trailing spaces, or mixed data types (numbers formatted as text, etc.).\n* **Missing data:** Empty cells represented by blanks or specific symbols like \"-\".\n* **Redundant data:** Repeated entries or unnecessary columns.\n\nThe other section shows the same data after transformation, demonstrating improvements such as:\n\n* **Cleaned data:** Consistent capitalization, removal of extra spaces, and corrected data types.\n* **Data standardization:**  Uniform formatting applied across the entire dataset.\n* **Data consolidation:** Merged or summarized data to reduce redundancy.\n* **New calculated columns:** Columns containing the result of formulas applied to the original data (e.g., sums, averages, percentages).\n\n\n**Possible Scenario 2:  A step-by-step guide to data transformation.**\n\nThe image could show a series of screenshots, each depicting a different stage in the data transformation process. This might include:\n\n* **Screenshot 1:** The original, messy data.\n* **Screenshot 2:**  The use of Excel's \"Find and Replace\" function to correct capitalization or remove extra spaces.  Perhaps a highlighted section shows the find and replace dialog box.\n* **Screenshot 3:** The application of a formula (e.g., `TRIM()`, `UPPER()`, `LOWER()`, `VALUE()`) in a new column to clean the data. This might include highlighting the formula bar showing the specific formula used.\n* **Screenshot 4:** The use of filtering or sorting to isolate and manage specific data subsets.\n* **Screenshot 5:** The final, clean, and transformed data.\n\n\n**Possible Scenario 3:  Focus on a specific transformation technique.**\n\nThe image could concentrate on a particular data transformation technique, such as:\n\n* **Pivot Tables:**  A screenshot showing how a pivot table summarizes and re-organizes data, allowing for better analysis.\n* **Data Validation:**  A screenshot showing the use of data validation rules to ensure data quality and consistency.\n* **Text to Columns:**  A screenshot illustrating the splitting of a single column into multiple columns based on delimiters.\n* **Power Query (Get & Transform):**  A screenshot demonstrating the use of Power Query's powerful data cleaning and transformation capabilities.\n\n\n**For student assistance, regardless of the specific content, the image should clearly illustrate:**\n\n* **The problem:**  The initial state of the data, highlighting its flaws.\n* **The solution:** The steps or techniques used to address these flaws.\n* **The result:** The improved, transformed data ready for analysis or use.\n\nBy understanding these potential scenarios, students can better interpret the image and learn from its contents.

This could include:\n\n* **Bar charts:**  These use rectangular bars of varying lengths to compare different categories of data.  Taller bars represent larger values.  They're good for showing comparisons between discrete groups.\n\n* **Line charts:** These use lines to connect data points, showing trends over time or across continuous variables. They're excellent for illustrating changes and patterns.\n\n* **Pie charts:** These divide a circle into slices, each representing a proportion of the whole. They are effective at showing the relative sizes of different parts of a total.\n\n* **Scatter plots:** These plot individual data points on a graph, showing the relationship between two variables.  They reveal correlations and clusters.\n\n* **Maps:**  These use geographical locations to represent data, often showing variations in a particular variable across different regions.\n\n* **Heatmaps:** These use color gradients to represent data density or magnitude. Darker colors often indicate higher values.\n\n* **Infographics:**  These combine various visual elements (charts, icons, text) to tell a data-driven story in an engaging way.\n\n\nTo help students further, consider these questions to ask when analyzing a data visualization:\n\n* **What is the main point the visualization is trying to communicate?**\n* **What type of chart or graph is used, and why is it appropriate for the data?**\n* **What are the key data points or trends shown?**\n* **What are the units of measurement used (e.g., dollars, percentages, counts)?**\n* **Are there any labels or legends to explain the data?**\n* **What conclusions can be drawn from the visualization?**\n* **Are there any limitations or potential biases in the data or its representation?**\n\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, students can effectively analyze and understand the information conveyed in the image.

To assist students, a detailed description needs to assume various possible image contents.  The image could show one or more of the following:\n\n**Possible Image Contents & Descriptions for Student Understanding:**\n\n* **A flowchart:** This would visually represent the data transformation process.  The flowchart might start with a raw data source (e.g., a database, CSV file), then show data being ingested into dbt, followed by steps like cleaning, transforming, and validating the data using dbt models (represented as boxes or nodes), culminating in a refined, transformed dataset ready for analysis or use in a data warehouse.  Look for labels describing each step, such as \"Source Data,\" \"Data Cleaning,\" \"Data Transformation,\" \"Data Validation,\" and \"Target Data.\"\n\n* **A diagram comparing before and after:** This would show raw, messy data on one side and the clean, transformed data on the other, with dbt clearly positioned as the tool enabling the transformation.  The difference between the before and after might highlight aspects like data type conversions, handling missing values, or data aggregation.  Look for examples of how specific data points have been changed or reorganized.\n\n* **A code snippet:** The image might show a dbt model written in SQL or another supported language. This would exemplify how users interact with dbt to specify data transformations.  Look for keywords like `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `CASE`, etc., which are common in SQL-based data transformation.  The code should be clearly labeled and potentially accompanied by comments explaining its function.\n\n* **A screenshot of the dbt IDE or CLI:** This would display the user interface of dbt, showing how users manage their projects, models, and transformations.  Look for elements such as a project structure, model files, or logs.\n\n* **A combination of the above:** The most likely scenario is a combination of these elements, for instance, a flowchart showing the overall process, with a small code snippet showcasing a specific transformation within the flowchart.\n\n\n**Regardless of the specific content, here's what students should focus on:**\n\n* **The role of dbt:** Understand that dbt is a tool specifically designed for transforming data.  It allows users to define transformations in a modular and repeatable manner.\n\n* **The data transformation process:** Identify the key steps involved, such as data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and loading.\n\n* **The benefits of using dbt:**  Consider why dbt is preferred over manual transformations – likely reasons include improved code organization, reproducibility, maintainability, and collaboration features.\n\n* **The input and output:**  Pay attention to the source data and the resulting transformed data.  Observe how dbt modifies the data to meet specific requirements.\n\n\nBy carefully analyzing the image based on these descriptions, students can gain a comprehensive understanding of \"Data Transformation with dbt.\"]](https://youtu.be/5rNquRnNb4E)\n\nYou'll learn how to transform data using dbt (data build tool), covering:\n\n- **dbt Fundamentals**: Understand what dbt is and how it brings software engineering practices to data transformation\n- **Project Setup**: Learn how to initialize a dbt project, configure your warehouse connection, and structure your models\n- **Models and Materialization**: Create your first dbt models and understand different materialization strategies (view, table, incremental)\n- **Testing and Documentation**: Implement data quality tests and auto-generate documentation for your data models\n- **Jinja Templating**: Use Jinja for dynamic SQL generation, making your transformations more maintainable and reusable\n- **References and Dependencies**: Learn how to reference other models and manage model dependencies\n- **Sources and Seeds**: Configure source data connections and manage static reference data\n- **Macros and Packages**: Create reusable macros and leverage community packages to extend functionality\n- **Incremental Models**: Optimize performance by only processing new or changed data\n- **Deployment and Orchestration**: Set up dbt Cloud or integrate with Airflow for production deployment\n\nHere's a minimal dbt model example, `models/staging/stg_customers.sql`:\n\n```sql\nwith source as (\n    select * from {{ source('raw', 'customers') }}\n),\n\nrenamed as (\n    select\n        id as customer_id,\n        first_name,\n        last_name,\n        email,\n        created_at\n    from source\n)\n\nselect * from renamed\n```\n\nTools and Resources:\n\n- [dbt Core](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core) - The open-source transformation tool\n- [dbt Cloud](https://www.getdbt.com/product/dbt-cloud) - Hosted platform for running dbt\n- [dbt Packages](https://hub.getdbt.com/) - Reusable modules from the community\n- [dbt Documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/) - Comprehensive guides and references\n- [Jaffle Shop](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop) - Example dbt project for learning\n- [dbt Slack Community](https://www.getdbt.com/community/) - Active community for support and discussions\n\nWatch this dbt Fundamentals Course (90 min):\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"dbt Fundamentals Course\" indicates an image related to a course teaching the fundamentals of dbt (data build tool).

Podman is compatible with Docker and has better security (and a slightly more open license). In this course, we recommend Podman but Docker works in the same way.\n\nInitialize the container engine:\n\n```bash\npodman machine init\npodman machine start\n```\n\nCommon Operations. (You can use `docker` instead of `podman` in the same way.)\n\n```bash\n# Pull an image\npodman pull python:3.11-slim\n\n# Run a container\npodman run -it python:3.11-slim\n\n# List containers\npodman ps -a\n\n# Stop container\npodman stop container_id\n\n# Scan image for vulnerabilities\npodman scan myapp:latest\n\n# Remove container\npodman rm container_id\n\n# Remove all stopped containers\npodman container prune\n```\n\nYou can create a `Dockerfile` to build a container image. Here's a sample `Dockerfile` that converts a Python script into a container image.\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM python:3.11-slim\n# Set working directory\nWORKDIR /app\n# Typically, you would use `COPY . .` to copy files from the host machine,\n# but here we're just using a simple script.\nRUN echo 'print(\"Hello, world!\")' > app.py\n# Run the script\nCMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"]\n```\n\nTo build, run, and deploy the container, run these commands:\n\n```bash\n# Create an account on https://hub.docker.com/ and then login\npodman login docker.io\n\n# Build and run the container\npodman build -t py-hello .\npodman run -it py-hello\n\n# Push the container to Docker Hub. Replace $DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME with your Docker Hub username.\npodman push py-hello:latest docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello\n\n# Push adding a specific tag, e.g. dev\nTAG=dev podman push py-hello docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello:$TAG\n```\n\nTools:\n\n- [Dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive): Explore image layers\n- [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo): Work with container images\n- [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy): Security scanner\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"Podman Tutorial Zero to Hero | Full 1 Hour Course\" describes an educational image likely depicting a thumbnail or promotional graphic for a one-hour online video course teaching Podman.  Let's break down what that implies for students:\n\n* **Podman:** This is the core subject. Podman is a daemonless container engine for Linux.  Students should understand that the course will teach them how to use Podman to create, manage, and run containers.  Prior knowledge of containers or virtualization is helpful but might not be strictly necessary, as the \"Zero to Hero\" title suggests a beginner-friendly approach.\n\n* **Tutorial:** This clarifies the format. The image likely shows a screen capture of a video player, a course website, or a visual representation related to the Podman workflow. Expect a step-by-step instructional approach.\n\n* **Zero to Hero:** This indicates a comprehensive course covering all levels, from basic concepts to advanced techniques.  Students can anticipate learning everything needed to become proficient in using Podman.\n\n* **Full 1 Hour Course:** This specifies the duration.  The course is concise and focused, likely aiming for efficiency. While it's unlikely to cover *every* aspect of Podman in an hour, students should expect a solid foundation.\n\nTherefore, a student encountering this image should anticipate a video tutorial that will take them from no prior knowledge of Podman to a working understanding of its core functionalities within an hour.  The image itself would probably visually reflect this, possibly showing a Podman logo, command-line interface screenshots, or a visual representation of containerization.  The overall tone should convey ease of learning and a promise of achieving practical skills.]](https://youtu.be/YXfA5O5Mr18)\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"Learn Docker in 7 Easy Steps - Full Beginner's Tutorial\" indicates an educational image likely depicting a flowchart, diagram, or a series of numbered steps illustrating the process of learning Docker for beginners.  The image probably breaks down the learning curve into seven manageable chunks.  \n\nWithout seeing the image itself, I can only speculate on the content, but it might include elements like:\n\n* **Seven distinct steps:**  Each step would be clearly labeled (1-7) and visually separated from the others.\n* **Visual aids:**  The image might use icons, screenshots, or simple drawings to represent concepts like containers, images, registries, or commands.\n* **Concise explanations:** Each step would likely have a brief, easily understandable description or caption.  The language would be tailored to beginners, avoiding jargon as much as possible.\n* **Logical flow:** The steps would be presented in a sequential order, progressing from basic concepts to more advanced ones.  The visual layout would reinforce this flow (e.g., a flowchart or numbered list).\n* **Focus on key concepts:** The image would emphasize crucial Docker concepts, such as building images, running containers, managing networks, and working with Docker Compose (potentially).\n\nIn short, the image aims to provide a simplified, visually appealing guide to learning Docker, making the process less daunting for novice users.

    "content": "## Embeddings: OpenAI and Local Models\n\nEmbedding models convert text into a list of numbers. These are like a map of text in numerical form. Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar.\n\nThis is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems:\n\n1. **Search**. Find similar documents to a query.\n2. **Classification**. Classify text into categories.\n3. **Clustering**. Group similar items into clusters.\n4. **Anomaly Detection**. Find an unusual piece of text.\n\nYou can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost. APIs are better for scale and quality.\n\n| Feature     | Local Models               | API                       |\n| ----------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| **Privacy** | High                       | Dependent on provider     |\n| **Cost**    | High setup, low after that | Pay-as-you-go             |\n| **Scale**   | Limited by local resources | Easily scales with demand |\n| **Quality** | Varies by model            | Typically high            |\n\nThe [Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) provides comprehensive comparisons of embedding models. These models are compared on several parameters, but here are some key ones to look at:\n\n1. **Rank**. Higher ranked models have higher quality.\n2. **Memory Usage**. Lower is better (for similar ranks). It costs less and is faster to run.\n3. **Embedding Dimensions**. Lower is better. This is the number of numbers in the array. Smaller dimensions are cheaper to store.\n4. **Max Tokens**. Higher is better. This is the number of input tokens (words) the model can take in a _single_ input.\n5. Look for higher scores in the columns for Classification, Clustering, Summarization, etc. based on your needs.\n\n### Local Embeddings\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"Guide to Local Embeddings with Sentence Transformers\" indicates an educational image explaining how to use Sentence Transformers to create and utilize local embeddings.  The image likely depicts a flowchart, diagram, or a series of steps illustrating this process.  To assist students, let's consider what the image might contain:\n\n**Possible Elements of the Image:**\n\n* **Introduction to Sentence Transformers:** A brief definition or explanation of what Sentence Transformers are and why they're useful for creating embeddings (vector representations of sentences).  This might include mentioning their ability to generate semantically meaningful vectors.\n\n* **Steps in Creating Local Embeddings:** A visual representation of the process, possibly a flowchart showing:\n    * **Data Preparation:**  This might involve steps like data cleaning, pre-processing (e.g., tokenization, stemming, lemmatization), and potentially splitting the data into training and testing sets.\n    * **Model Selection and Loading:**  Showing the selection of a pre-trained Sentence Transformer model (e.g., 'all-mpnet-base-v2', 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2') or training a custom model.  The image might visually represent loading the chosen model.\n    * **Embedding Generation:**  Illustrating the process of feeding sentences into the chosen model and obtaining their corresponding embedding vectors. This might be represented with a box showing input sentences transforming into vector outputs.\n    * **Embedding Storage:**  Showing how the generated embeddings are stored locally, perhaps referencing file formats like `.npy` or a database.  This might highlight the importance of efficient storage for large datasets.\n\n* **Example Code Snippets (Possible):**  Small segments of Python code illustrating key steps like importing the necessary libraries (e.g., `sentence-transformers`), loading the model, generating embeddings, and saving them.\n\n* **Visual Representation of Embeddings:**  The image might include a simple visualization of embedding vectors as points in a multi-dimensional space, illustrating how semantically similar sentences cluster closer together.\n\n* **Applications of Local Embeddings:**  A brief mention of how these locally stored embeddings can be used in downstream tasks like semantic search, similarity calculations, or clustering.\n\n* **Comparison to Remote Embeddings (Possible):** A brief comparison highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of using local embeddings versus relying on a remote embedding service.\n\n\n**How the Image Helps Students:**\n\nThe image provides a concise, visual summary of the process, making it easier to understand than a purely textual explanation.  The visual elements help students grasp the flow of the process and the relationships between different steps.  Code snippets, if included, provide practical examples for implementation. The visualization of embeddings helps to solidify the abstract concept of vector representations.  The image serves as a quick reference guide, allowing students to review the key steps and concepts at a glance.]](https://youtu.be/OATCgQtNX2o)\n\nHere's a minimal example using a local embedding model:\n\n```python\n# /// script\n# requires-python = \"==3.12\"\n# dependencies = [\n#   \"sentence-transformers\",\n#   \"httpx\",\n#   \"numpy\",\n# ]\n# ///\n\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nimport numpy as np\n\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5')  # A small, high quality model\n\nasync def embed(text: str) -> list[float]:\n    \"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using local model.\"\"\"\n    return model.encode(text).tolist()\n\nasync def get_similarity(text1: str, text2: str) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Calculate cosine similarity between two texts.\"\"\"\n    emb1 = np.array(await embed(text1))\n    emb2 = np.array(await embed(text2))\n    return float(np.dot(emb1, emb2) / (np.linalg.norm(emb1) * np.linalg.norm(emb2)))\n\nasync def main():\n    print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Orange\"))\n    print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Lightning\"))\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import asyncio\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nNote the `get_similarity` function. It uses a [Cosine Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) to calculate the similarity between two embeddings.\n\n### OpenAI Embeddings\n\nFor comparison, here's how to use OpenAI's API with direct HTTP calls. Replace the `embed` function in the earlier script:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport httpx\n\nasync def embed(text: str) -> list[float]:\n    \"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using OpenAI's API.\"\"\"\n    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:\n        response = await client.post(\n            \"https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings\",\n            headers={\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']}\"},\n            json={\"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": text}\n        )\n        return response.json()[\"data\"][0][\"embedding\"]\n```\n\n**NOTE**: You need to set the [`OPENAI_API_KEY`](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) environment variable for this to work.\n",

The image itself is not described, so we can only speculate on its content based on the alt text.  A likely depiction would be one or more of the following:\n\n* **A visually appealing infographic:** This could involve a simplified flowchart showing the basic workflow of FFmpeg, perhaps highlighting key commands or functionalities with icons.  It might use color-coding to differentiate between input, process, and output stages.\n\n* **A screenshot of the FFmpeg command line interface:**  This would show a terminal window with examples of FFmpeg commands being typed and executed, possibly with the output displayed beneath.  The commands shown would likely be simple and illustrative, such as converting a video file format or extracting audio.\n\n* **A series of before-and-after images/videos:** This would visually demonstrate the effects of FFmpeg commands.  For example, a video might show a low-resolution input next to a higher-resolution output, or a video with a watermark next to one without.\n\n* **A combination of the above:** The image might integrate elements of all the descriptions above for a more comprehensive overview.\n\n**For student assistance, the image should help with:**\n\n* **Understanding FFmpeg's basic purpose:**  The image should convey that FFmpeg is a powerful tool for handling multimedia files (audio and video).\n* **Grasping the overall workflow:**  The image should give a high-level understanding of how to use FFmpeg, even without deep technical knowledge.\n* **Seeing practical examples:** Concrete examples of commands or transformations will aid in understanding and allow students to experiment themselves.\n\n\nWithout the actual image, this is the best description possible.

This saves the output in JSON as well as SRT format in the source directory.\n\n```bash\nfaster-whisper-xxl --print_progress --output_dir source --batch_recursive \\\n                   --check_files --standard --output_format json srt \\\n                   --model medium --language en $FILE\n```\n\n- `--model`: The OpenAI Whisper model to use. You can choose from:\n  - `tiny`: Fastest but least accurate\n  - `base`: Good for simple audio\n  - `small`: Balanced speed/accuracy\n  - `medium`: Recommended default\n  - `large-v3`: Most accurate but slowest\n- `--output_format`: The output format to use. You can pick multiple formats from:\n  - `json`: Has the most detailed information including timing, text, quality, etc.\n  - `srt`: A popular subtitle format. You can use this in YouTube, for example.\n  - `vtt`: A modern subtitle format.\n  - `txt`: Just the text transcript\n- `--output_dir`: The directory to save the output files. `source` indicates the source directory, i.e. where the input `$FILE` is\n- `--language`: The language of the input file. If you don't specify it, it analyzes the first 30 seconds to auto-detect. You can speed it up by specifying it.\n\nRun `faster-whisper-xxl --help` for more options.\n\n## Gemini transcription\n\nThe [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) models from Google are notable in two ways:\n\n1. They have a _huge_ input context window. Gemini 2.0 Flash can accept 1M tokens, for example.\n2. They can handle audio input.\n\nThis allows us to use Gemini to transcribe audio files.\n\nLLMs are not good at transcribing audio _faithfully_. They tend to correct errors and meander from what was said. But they are intelligent. That enables a few powerful workflows. Here are some examples:\n\n1. **Transcribe into other languages**. Gemini will handle the transcription and translation in a single step.\n2. **Summarize audio transcripts**. For example, convert a podcast into a tutorial, or a meeting recording into actions.\n3. **Legal Proceeding Analysis**. Extract case citations, dates, and other details from a legal debate.\n4. **Medical Consultation Summary**. Extract treatments, medications, details of next visit, etc. from a medical consultation.\n\nHere's how to use Gemini to transcribe audio files.\n\n1. Get a [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) from Google AI Studio.\n2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable to the API key.\n3. Set the `MP3_FILE` environment variable to the path of the MP3 file you want to transcribe.\n4. Run this code:\n   ```bash\n   curl -X POST https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash-002:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse \\\n     -H \"X-Goog-API-Key: $GEMINI_API_KEY\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d \"$(cat << EOF\n   {\n     \"contents\": [\n       {\n         \"role\": \"user\",\n         \"parts\": [\n           {\n             \"inline_data\": {\n               \"mime_type\": \"audio/mp3\",\n               \"data\": \"$(base64 --wrap=0 $MP3_FILE)\"\n             }\n           },\n           {\"text\": \"Transcribe this\"}\n         ]\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n   EOF\n   )\"\n   ```\n",

    "content": "## Forecasting with Excel\n\n[[Image Description: The image \"Forecasting with Excel\" likely depicts a spreadsheet within Microsoft Excel showing a forecasting model.  To assist students, we need to imagine the possible content.  The image probably showcases:\n\n* **Data Series:** A column or row of numerical data representing historical values. This could be sales figures, stock prices, temperature readings, or any other time-series data suitable for forecasting.  The data might span several periods (months, quarters, years).\n\n* **Forecast Line:** A distinct line or series of points superimposed on the historical data. This line represents the predicted future values based on the chosen forecasting model.  It's likely visually different from the historical data (e.g., a different color or line style).\n\n* **Forecast Model (possibly implicit):**  The image might subtly or explicitly indicate the type of forecasting method used (e.g., moving average, exponential smoothing, linear regression). This could be through a formula visible in a cell, a chart title specifying the model, or the visual characteristics of the forecast line itself (a straight line suggesting linear regression, a smoother curve suggesting exponential smoothing).\n\n* **Confidence Intervals (possibly):**  Advanced forecasting might include shaded areas around the forecast line.  These represent confidence intervals, indicating the range within which the actual future values are likely to fall with a certain probability (e.g., 95% confidence interval).\n\n* **Chart Type:** The data is likely presented in a chart, most probably a line graph, to visually represent the historical data and the forecast.  This allows for easy comparison and understanding of trends.\n\n* **Excel Functions (possibly):**  The image might include examples of Excel functions used in the forecasting process, such as `FORECAST.LINEAR`, `FORECAST.ETS`, or `TREND`. These functions are crucial for automating the forecasting process.\n\nIn short, the image aims to visually demonstrate how Excel can be used to create forecasts by inputting historical data and applying statistical models to predict future values. The visual representation makes understanding complex forecasting concepts more accessible to students.

    "content": "## Function Calling with OpenAI\n\n[Function Calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) allows Large Language Models to convert natural language into structured function calls. This is perfect for building chatbots and AI assistants that need to interact with your backend systems.\n\nOpenAI supports [Function Calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) -- a way for LLMs to suggest what functions to call and how.\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"OpenAI Function Calling - Full Beginner Tutorial\" indicates an image likely depicting a tutorial aimed at teaching beginners how to use OpenAI's Function Calling feature.  The image itself could take many forms, but here are some possibilities and how to interpret them for student assistance:\n\n**Possible Image Contents & Interpretations for Students:**\n\n* **Screenshot of a Code Example:**  The image might be a screenshot of a Jupyter Notebook, a code editor (like VS Code), or a similar environment showing Python code demonstrating function calling with OpenAI's API.  Look for:\n    * **API Keys:**  (Possibly obscured or redacted for security)  These are crucial for authentication.\n    * **Function Definitions:**  This would showcase how to define the functions OpenAI can call to perform specific tasks (e.g., calculating a sum, converting units, extracting information from text).  Pay close attention to the function's inputs and outputs (parameters and return values).\n    * **API Call:** The core part would show how to structure the request to the OpenAI API, including the `functions` parameter with a description of the available functions.\n    * **Response Handling:** How the code receives and processes the response from the OpenAI API, including error handling.  The response might include the function chosen by the model and its arguments.\n\n* **Flowchart or Diagram:** The image could illustrate the steps involved in function calling, visually representing the interaction between the user's code, the OpenAI model, and the defined functions. Look for:\n    * **User Input:** Where the user provides the initial prompt or data.\n    * **Model Selection:** How the model chooses which function to call based on the user's input.\n    * **Function Execution:** The execution of the chosen function.\n    * **Output Generation:** How the function's result is used to generate the final output.\n\n* **Combination of Code and Diagram:**  A more comprehensive tutorial image might combine code snippets with a visual flowchart or diagram to explain the process more effectively.\n\n* **Conceptual Illustration:** A less technical image might use an abstract graphic to represent the core idea of function calling, with labels explaining the key concepts (user prompt, function selection, function execution, final response).\n\n**Helping Students Understand the Image:**\n\nRegardless of the specific content, guide students to focus on these key aspects:\n\n* **The Purpose of Function Calling:** Explain that it allows developers to provide the AI with specific tools (functions) it can use to accomplish more complex tasks, making the interaction more structured and predictable.\n* **Defining Functions:** Emphasize the importance of clearly defining the functions, including their inputs and outputs, so the AI can understand how to use them.\n* **Structuring the API Request:** Highlight the specific parameters needed in the API call to utilize the defined functions.\n* **Interpreting the Response:** Explain how the response from the OpenAI API indicates which function was chosen and the results it produced.\n* **Error Handling:**  If shown, explain how to gracefully handle situations where the AI might not select a function, or a function might fail.\n\nBy analyzing the image based on these points, students can gain a valuable understanding of how OpenAI Function Calling works.

Always set `strict: True` to ensure valid function calls\n   - Define all required parameters\n   - Set `additionalProperties: False`\n2. **Use tool choice**\n   - Set `tool_choice: \"required\"` to ensure that the model will always call one or more tools\n   - The default is `tool_choice: \"auto\"` which means the model will choose a tool only if appropriate\n3. **Clear Descriptions**\n   - Write detailed function and parameter descriptions\n   - Include expected formats and units\n   - Mention any constraints or limitations\n4. **Error Handling**\n   - Validate function inputs before execution\n   - Return clear error messages\n   - Handle missing or invalid parameters\n",

    "content": "## Geospatial Analysis with QGIS\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"Geospatial analysis with QGIS\" indicates an image depicting the use of the open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) software, QGIS, for geospatial analysis.  To assist students, a detailed description would need to imagine what the image *might* show, as there's no image provided.  Here are several possibilities, along with explanations useful for students:\n\n**Possible Image Scenarios & Descriptions for Students:**\n\n* **Scenario 1: QGIS Interface with a Map:** The image likely shows the QGIS user interface (UI). This would include:\n    * **The main window:**  A large area displaying a map.  This map could show various layers (e.g., roads, buildings, elevation, points of interest), potentially with different colours and symbols representing different data.  Students should note how different data is visually represented.\n    * **Toolbars and panels:**  Various toolbars along the top and sides of the window.  These toolbars contain buttons and menus for adding layers, editing features, performing analysis, and customizing the map's appearance.  Mention specific tools they might recognize (e.g., zoom, pan, select features).\n    * **Layer Panel:** A panel listing the different data layers currently loaded in the map.  This allows users to control the visibility and order of layers.  This is crucial for understanding map complexity and layering.\n    * **A specific analysis in progress:** Perhaps a buffer analysis (creating zones around points), a spatial join (combining data from different layers), or a network analysis (finding shortest routes). This would be highlighted visually, potentially showing intermediate steps or results.\n\n\n* **Scenario 2: A Result of Geospatial Analysis:** The image may focus on the *output* of a QGIS analysis. This could be:\n    * **A thematic map:**  A map showing spatial patterns using colour or symbology to represent a specific variable (e.g., population density, crime rates, soil types). Students should focus on interpreting the visual representation of data and the conclusions it allows.\n    * **A graph or chart:**  A chart showing statistical data derived from the spatial data.  For example, a histogram of elevation values or a graph showing the relationship between two variables.  This highlights the quantitative analysis capabilities of QGIS.\n    * **A table of attributes:** A table showing data associated with features on the map.  This illustrates how spatial data is linked to non-spatial attributes (e.g., population data linked to polygon representing census tracts).\n\n\n* **Scenario 3: A Workflow Diagram:** The image might be a flowchart showing the steps involved in a geospatial analysis project using QGIS. This would help students understand the overall process, from data acquisition and preparation to analysis and visualization.\n\n\n**Regardless of the specific content, students should consider:**\n\n* **The power of visualization:** How QGIS makes complex spatial data easier to understand.\n* **The importance of data:** The quality and accuracy of the underlying data greatly impacts the reliability of the analysis.\n* **The flexibility of QGIS:** Its open-source nature and extensive plugin library provide versatile tools for many types of geospatial analysis.\n\n\nBy considering these possibilities, students can better interpret the image and understand the role of QGIS in geospatial analysis.  They should pay attention to the visual elements, their purpose, and how they contribute to the overall understanding of the data.]](https://youtu.be/tJhehs0o-ik)\n\nYou'll learn how to use QGIS for geographic data processing, covering:\n\n- **Shapefiles and KML Files**: Create and manage shapefiles and KML files for storing and analyzing geographic information.\n- **Downloading QGIS**: Install QGIS on different operating systems and familiarize yourself with its interface.\n- **Geospatial Data**: Access and utilize shapefiles from sources like Diva-GIS and integrate them into QGIS projects.\n- **Creating Custom Shapefiles**: Learn how to create custom shapefiles when existing ones are unavailable, including creating a shapefile for South Sudan.\n- **Editing and Visualization**: Use QGIS tools to edit shapefiles, add attributes, and visualize geographic data with various styling and labeling options.\n- **Exporting Data**: Export shapefiles or KML files for use in other applications, such as Google Earth.\n\nHere are links used in the video:\n\n- [QGIS Project](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/)\n- [Shapefile Data](https://www.diva-gis.org/gdata)\n",

    "content": "## Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (Hybrid RAG) with TypeSense\n\nHybrid RAG combines semantic (vector) search with traditional keyword search to improve retrieval accuracy and relevance. By mixing exact text matches with embedding-based similarity, you get the best of both worlds: precision when keywords are present, and semantic recall when phrasing varies. [TypeSense](https://typesense.org/) makes this easy with built-in hybrid search and automatic embedding generation.\n\nBelow is a fully self-contained Hybrid RAG tutorial using TypeSense, Python, and the command line.\n\n### Install and run TypeSense\n\n[Install TypeSense](https://typesense.org/docs/guide/install-typesense.html).\n\n```bash\nmkdir typesense-data\n\ndocker run -p 8108:8108 \\\n  -v typesense-data:/data typesense/typesense:28.0 \\\n  --data-dir /data \\\n  --api-key=secret-key \\\n  --enable-cors\n```\n\n- **`docker run`**: spins up a containerized TypeSense server on port 8108\n  - `-p 8108:8108` maps host port to container port.\n  - `-v typesense-data:/data` mounts a Docker volume for persistence.\n  - `--data-dir /data` points TypeSense at that volume.\n  - `--api-key=secret-key` secures your API.\n  - `--enable-cors` allows browser-based requests.\n\n**Expected output:**\n\n- Docker logs showing TypeSense startup messages, such as `Started Typesense API server`.\n- Listening on `http://0.0.0.0:8108`.\n\n### Embed and import documents into TypeSense\n\nFollow the steps in the [RAG with the CLI](rag-cli.md) tutorial to create a `chunks.json` that has one `{id, content}` JSON object per line.\n\n[TypeSense supports automatic embedding of documents](https://typesense.org/docs/28.0/api/vector-search.html#option-b-auto-embedding-generation-within-typesense). We'll use that capability.\n\nSave the following as `addnotes.py` and run it with `uv run addnotes.py`.\n\n```python\n# /// script\n# requires-python = \">=3.13\"\n# dependencies = [\"httpx\"]\n# ///\nimport json\nimport httpx\nimport os\n\nheaders = {\"X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY\": \"secret-key\"}\n\nschema = {\n    \"name\": \"notes\",\n    \"fields\": [\n        {\"name\": \"id\", \"type\": \"string\", \"facet\": False},\n        {\"name\": \"content\", \"type\": \"string\", \"facet\": False},\n        {\n            \"name\": \"embedding\",\n            \"type\": \"float[]\",\n            \"embed\": {\n                \"from\": [\"content\"],\n                \"model_config\": {\n                    \"model_name\": \"openai/text-embedding-3-small\",\n                    \"api_key\": os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"),\n                },\n            },\n        },\n    ],\n}\n\nwith open(\"chunks.json\", \"r\") as f:\n    chunks = [json.loads(line) for line in f.readlines()]\n\nwith httpx.Client() as client:\n    # Create the collection\n    if client.get(f\"http://localhost:8108/collections/notes\", headers=headers).status_code == 404:\n        r = client.post(\"http://localhost:8108/collections\", json=schema, headers=headers)\n\n    # Embed the chunks\n    result = client.post(\n        \"http://localhost:8108/collections/notes/documents/import?action=emplace\",\n        headers={**headers, \"Content-Type\": \"text/plain\"},\n        data=\"\\n\".join(json.dumps(chunk) for chunk in chunks),\n    )\n    print(result.text)\n```\n\n- **`httpx.Client`**: an HTTP client for Python.\n- **Collection schema**: `id` and `content` fields plus an `embedding` field with auto-generated embeddings from OpenAI.\n- **Auto-embedding**: the `embed` block instructs TypeSense to call the specified model for each document.\n- **`GET /collections/notes`**: checks existence.\n- **`POST /collections`**: creates the collection.\n- **`POST /collections/notes/documents/import?action=emplace`**: bulk upsert documents, embedding them on the fly.\n\n**Expected output:**\n\n- A JSON summary string like `{\"success\": X, \"failed\": 0}` indicating how many docs were imported.\n- (On timeouts, re-run until all chunks are processed.)\n\n### 4. Run a hybrid search and answer a question\n\nNow, we can use a single `curl` against the Multi-Search endpoint to combine keyword and vector search as a [hybrid search](https://typesense.org/docs/28.0/api/vector-search.html#hybrid-search):\n\n```bash\nQ=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\"\n\npayload=$(jq -n --arg coll \"notes\" --arg q \"$Q\" \\\n  '{\n     searches: [\n       {\n         collection: $coll,\n         q:           $q,\n         query_by:    \"content,embedding\",\n         sort_by:     \"_text_match:desc\",\n         prefix:      false,\n         exclude_fields: \"embedding\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }'\n)\ncurl -s 'http://localhost:8108/multi_search' \\\n  -H \"X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY: secret-key\" \\\n  -d \"$payload\" \\\n  | jq -r '.results[].hits[].document.content' \\\n  | llm -s \"${Q} - \\$Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from the notes.\" \\\n  | uvx streamdown\n```\n\n- **`query_by: \"content,embedding\"`**: tells TypeSense to score by both keyword and vector similarity.\n- **`sort_by: \"_text_match:desc\"`**: boosts exact text hits.\n- **`exclude_fields: \"embedding\"`**: keeps responses lightweight.\n- **`curl -d`**: posts the search request.\n- **`jq -r`**: extracts each hit’s `content`. See [jq manual](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/)\n- **`llm -s`** and **`uvx streamdown`**: generate and stream a grounded answer.\n\n**Expected output:**\n\n- The raw matched snippets printed first.\n- Then a concise, streamed LLM answer citing the note verbatim.\n",

    "content": "## Images: Compression\n\nImage compression is essential when deploying apps. Often, pages have dozens of images. Image analysis runs over thousands of images. The cost of storage and bandwidth can grow over time.\n\nHere are things you should know when you're compressing images:\n\n- **Image dimensions** are the width and height of the image in pixels. This impacts image size a lot\n- **Lossless** compression (PNG, WebP) preserves exact data\n- **Lossy** compression (JPEG, WebP) removes some data for smaller files\n- **Vector** formats (SVG) scale without quality loss\n- **WebP** is the modern standard, supporting both lossy and lossless\n\nHere's a rule of thumb you can use as of 2025.\n\n- Use SVG if you can (i.e. if it's vector graphics or you can convert it to one)\n- Else, reduce the image to as small as you can, and save as (lossy or lossless) WebP\n\nCommon operations with Python:\n\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport io\n\nasync def compress_image(input_path: Path, output_path: Path, quality: int = 85) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Compress an image while maintaining reasonable quality.\"\"\"\n    with Image.open(input_path) as img:\n        # Convert RGBA to RGB if needed\n        if img.mode == 'RGBA':\n            img = img.convert('RGB')\n        # Optimize for web\n        img.save(output_path, 'WEBP', quality=quality, optimize=True)\n\n# Batch process images\npaths = Path('images').glob('*.jpg')\nfor p in paths:\n    await compress_image(p, p.with_suffix('.webp'))\n```\n\nCommand line tools include [cwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp), [pngquant](https://pngquant.org/), [jpegoptim](https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim), and [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/).\n\n```bash\n# Convert to WebP\ncwebp -q 85 input.png -o output.webp\n\n# Optimize PNG\npngquant --quality=65-80 image.png\n\n# Optimize JPEG\njpegoptim --strip-all --all-progressive --max=85 image.jpg\n\n# Convert and resize\nconvert input.jpg -resize 800x600 output.jpg\n\n# Batch convert\nmogrify -format webp -quality 85 *.jpg\n```\n\nWatch this video on modern image formats and optimization (15 min):\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"Modern Image Optimization (15 min)\" suggests an image depicting the process or concept of modern image optimization, likely within a 15-minute timeframe.  Without seeing the actual image, I can only speculate on its contents, but here are several possibilities it might show:\n\n**Possible Depictions:**\n\n* **A flowchart or infographic:** This could visually represent the steps involved in optimizing images, such as choosing the right file format (JPEG, PNG, WebP), resizing images to appropriate dimensions, compressing images without significant loss of quality, and using appropriate alt text.  The 15-minute timeframe might be indicated by a timer icon or a clock.\n\n* **A before-and-after comparison:** The image could show an original, unoptimized image alongside its optimized counterpart, highlighting the differences in file size and visual quality.  The improvement in loading speed might also be visually represented.\n\n* **A screen recording or screenshot:** This could show a user interface of an image optimization tool, demonstrating the process of uploading, editing, and optimizing an image.  The 15-minute time frame could indicate the duration of the process shown.\n\n* **A collection of optimized images:**  The image could showcase examples of visually appealing and yet efficiently sized images, perhaps categorized by file type or use case.  This could be accompanied by data on file size reduction.\n\n\n**How a student can use this image:**\n\nRegardless of the specific content, the image aims to provide a quick overview of modern image optimization.  A student can use this image to:\n\n* **Understand the key aspects of image optimization:**  The image will likely highlight important concepts like file size, resolution, file format, and compression.\n* **Learn the process of optimization:** It might illustrate a step-by-step process or show the use of specific tools.\n* **Appreciate the impact of optimization:** By comparing before-and-after examples, a student can see the improvement in loading speed and overall website performance.\n* **Gain a time estimate:** The \"15 min\" suggests that the optimization process should be relatively quick and efficient.\n\n\nIn short, the image serves as a visual aid to quickly grasp the importance and methods of modern image optimization.

Its human-readable format and widespread support make it essential for data scientists working with web services, APIs, and configuration files.\n\nFor data scientists, JSON is essential when:\n\n- Working with REST APIs and web services\n- Storing configuration files and metadata\n- Parsing semi-structured data from databases like MongoDB\n- Creating data visualization specifications (e.g., Vega-Lite)\n\nWatch this comprehensive introduction to JSON (15 min):\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"JSON Crash Course\" suggests an educational image designed to quickly teach the basics of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).  Without seeing the image itself, I can only speculate on its content, but likely it would include elements such as:\n\n* **A title or heading:**  Clearly stating \"JSON Crash Course\" or a similar phrase.\n\n* **Key Concepts Explained Visually:** The image might use diagrams, charts, or tables to illustrate core JSON concepts. This could include:\n\n    * **Structure:** Showing the fundamental structure of JSON data – key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces `{}` for objects and square brackets `[]` for arrays.  Examples might highlight the difference between objects and arrays using simple, easily understood data like a person's details (name, age, city) as an object, and a list of their hobbies as an array.\n\n    * **Data Types:**  Illustrations of the basic JSON data types: strings (in quotes), numbers, booleans (`true` or `false`), null, and nested objects/arrays.  Visual cues, like different colors or shapes for each data type, could enhance understanding.\n\n    * **Example JSON:**  A well-formatted example of a JSON object or array, perhaps representing a simple data structure like a product catalog entry or a user profile.  This would showcase how keys and values are structured and used together.\n\n    * **Syntax:**  Visual representation of proper JSON syntax, perhaps highlighting the use of colons (`:`) to separate keys and values, commas (`,`) to separate key-value pairs and array elements, and the correct use of curly and square brackets.  It may even show common syntax errors to avoid.\n\n\n* **Simple, Concise Language:** The image would likely prioritize brevity and clarity, using easily digestible text and avoiding jargon.\n\n* **Color-coding and Visual Hierarchy:**  Colors and fonts would be used to emphasize key information and improve readability, making it easy for learners to quickly grasp the essential components.\n\nIn short, the image aims to provide a quick overview of JSON, focusing on its fundamental structure and syntax through clear visual aids and concise explanations.  It's designed for a rapid learning experience, suitable for a crash course format.]](https://youtu.be/GpOO5iKzOmY)\n\nKey concepts to understand in JSON:\n\n- JSON only supports 6 data types: strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays, and objects\n- You can nest data. Arrays and objects can contain other data types, including other arrays and objects\n- Always validate. Ensure JSON is well-formed. Comm errors: Trailing commas, missing quotes, and escape characters\n\n[JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) is a format that allows you to store multiple JSON objects in a single line.\nIt's useful for logging and streaming data.\n\nTools you could use with JSON:\n\n- [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/): Validate and format JSON\n- [JSON Editor Online](https://jsoneditoronline.org/): Visual JSON editor and formatter\n- [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/): Define the structure of your JSON data\n- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/): Command-line JSON processor\n\nCommon Python operations with JSON:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Parse JSON string\njson_str = '{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}'\ndata = json.loads(json_str)\n\n# Convert to JSON string\njson_str = json.dumps(data, indent=2)\n\n# Read JSON from file\nwith open('data.json') as f:\n    data = json.load(f)\n\n# Write JSON to file\nwith open('output.json', 'w') as f:\n    json.dump(data, f, indent=2)\n\n# Read JSON data a Pandas DataFrame.

(Don't exceed that.)\n\nRead the [AI Pipe documentation](https://github.com/sanand0/aipipe) to learn how to use it. But in short:\n\n1. Replace `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, i.e. `https://api.openai.com/v1` with `https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1...` or `https://aipipe.org/openai/v1...`\n2. Replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the [`AIPIPE_TOKEN`](https://aipipe.org/login)\n3. Replace model names, e.g. `gpt-4.1-nano`, with `openai/gpt-4.1-nano`\n\nFor example, let's use [Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/gemini/2-0-flash-lite) via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001) for chat completions and [Text Embedding 3 Small](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/text-embedding-3-small) via [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/) for embeddings:\n\n```bash\ncurl https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1/chat/completions \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"model\": \"google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\",\n    \"messages\": [{ \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is 2 + 2?\"} }]\n  }'\n\ncurl https://aipipe.org/openai/v1/embeddings \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN\" \\\n  -d '{ \"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": \"What is 2 + 2?\" }'\n```\n\nOr using [`llm`](https://llm.datasette.io/):\n\n```bash\nllm keys set openai --value $AIPIPE_TOKEN\n\nexport OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1\nllm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\n\nexport OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openai/v1\nllm embed -c 'What is 2 + 2' -m 3-small\n```\n\n**For a 50% discount** (but slower speed), use [Flex processing](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex-processing) by adding `service_tier: \"flex\"` to your JSON request.\n\n## AI Proxy - Jan 2025\n\nFor the Jan 2025 batch, we had created API keys for everyone with an `iitm.ac.in` email to use `gpt-4o-mini` and `text-embedding-3-small`. Your usage is limited to **$1 per calendar month** for this course. Don't exceed that.\n\n**Use [AI Proxy](https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy)** instead of OpenAI. Specifically:\n\n1. Replace your API to `https://api.openai.com/...` with `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/...`\n2. Replace the `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` that someone will give you.\n",

The \"Introduction\" in the title emphasizes that it's designed for beginners.]](https://youtu.be/VTBwpPT3A3U)\n\n**Q1: Where can I find the uploaded documents?**\n\n**A1:** The uploaded documents are added as part of a YouTube playlist. You should be able to see them on YouTube.\n\n**Q2: How should I approach TDS?**\n\n**A2:** The best way to learn TDS is through practice. The course is designed to handle day-to-day data science problems. It introduces everyday development tools (from VS Code to npm) and provides hands-on experience solving problems. The graded assignments (GAs) are practical exercises designed to reinforce theoretical concepts. Focus on working through the examples and familiarizing yourself with the tools.\n\n**Q3: I'm new to this field and struggling with basic concepts. What should I do?**\n\n**A3:** GA0 is a self-assessment. If you scored above 50%, you have a good foundation. If not, consider additional learning before proceeding. The course is hands-on, and the TAs will hold sessions to help you understand the tools. The course content is available on the course introduction page, not just in the GA modules.\n\n**Q4: The YouTube videos are not clear enough. Can we have personalized videos?**\n\n**A4:** The TAs will hold dedicated sessions to address this learning curve. These sessions will cover the tools in detail and will be recorded and uploaded.\n\n**Q5: I'm not from a science background and find the course difficult. What can I do?**\n\n**A5:** The course is not an intro to programming. Focus on the practical exercises and use the TAs' sessions to get help. The instructors will consider adding more introductory sessions to address the skill gap.\n\n**Q6: I took TDS two terms ago and haven't gained any extra skills. I only want to complete this course and leave. What should I do?**\n\n**A6:** The course has changed significantly since two terms ago. The instructors will consider adding more support sessions to help students catch up.\n\n**Q7: The deadline for GA1 is the 26th, and help was only provided after the deadline last term. Will this happen again?**\n\n**A7:** The TAs will hold sessions _before_ the GA deadline to help you learn how to use the tools.\n\n**Q8: The graded assignments (GAs) are practical, but the end-of-term exam is theory-based. Where can I learn the theory?**\n\n**A8:** The end-of-term exam format is changing. The instructors will provide a mock exam before the actual exam. Focus on familiarizing yourself with the tools.\n\n**Q9: I solved almost all the GA1 questions but my score is zero. Is this a glitch?**\n\n**A9:** Your answers are likely saved. If you added a question, re-enter all answers and save again. The instructors are working on a backend fix to prevent this.\n\n**Q10: What is the R0E and what should I focus on for grading?**\n\n**A10:** The projects are take-home, open-internet assignments. You'll receive a dataset and questions. R0E is a remote online exam (open-internet MCQ). The instructors will provide more information on both in future sessions.\n\n**Q11: I'm a non-IT student (Masters in Mathematics). Can I get an IT job with just the Data Science diploma?**\n\n**A11:** It's possible, but it depends on the company's requirements. Programming skills are valuable in many fields.\n\n**Q12: Should I take the programming diploma along with the data science diploma?**\n\n**A12:** Programming skills are very valuable. The two diplomas complement each other.\n\n**Q13: What are some standard tools I should focus on?**\n\n**A13:** Bash has been around since the 1970s. Focus on newer tools and techniques, such as LLMs and GPTs, which are powerful and in high demand.\n\n**Q14: What if I want to learn the tools more deeply?**\n\n**A14:** Learn by using the tools frequently in your workflows. The instructors will provide more support sessions.\n\n**Q15: Can we have sessions on installing the Linux system?**\n\n**A15:** The instructors will discuss this with the TAs and schedule sessions if needed. Note that you may not need to install a full Linux system; Google Colab provides a Linux environment.\n\n**Q16: Will the sessions be added to the Google Calendar?**\n\n**A16:** Yes, they will be added to a playlist on the Google Calendar. Bookmark the TDS channel to easily find the playlist. The videos themselves will be on YouTube.\n\n**Q17: Can you request the programming faculty to add content similar to TDS to the programming diploma?**\n\n**A17:** Post this request on Discourse and tag the relevant people.\n\n**Q18: What is a \"take-home open internet\" project?**\n\n**A18:** You'll receive a dataset and questions. You can use any resources to answer the questions.\n\n**Q19: What weeks are relevant to each project?**\n\n**A19:** Project 1 will cover the first four or five modules. Project 2 will cover a wider range of topics.\n\n**Q20: I have a basic understanding of the tools, but not a great one. Should I continue or drop the course?**\n\n**A20:** If you can solve the problems, that's good enough. The course is meant to introduce you to the tools, not make you an expert. Focus on the new tools and techniques. You can always get certifications for other skills later.\n",

    "content": "# Live Session: 16 Jan 2025\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"2025-01-16 Week 1 - Session 1 - TDS Jan 25\" describes metadata for an educational image, not the image itself.  It tells us the following about the image's context:\n\n* **Date Created/Used:** January 16th, 2025.\n* **Course/Program:** This likely belongs to a course or program, suggested by \"Week 1 - Session 1\". This is the first session of the first week.\n* **Subject/Abbreviation:** \"TDS\" is an abbreviation for the subject matter.  Without more context, it's impossible to know what TDS stands for (e.g., Total Dissolved Solids in environmental science, Tax Deferred Savings in finance, etc.).\n* **Date of Session:** The session's actual date is January 25th, suggesting a possible discrepancy between creation date and session date (perhaps the image was created in advance).\n\n**To help students, we need the actual image!**  The alt text only gives the *context* of where the image fits within a course.  To describe the image itself, we need to know what the image shows.  For example, is it:\n\n* **A diagram?**  (If so, what does it diagram?  Are there labels? What are the key features?)\n* **A photograph?** (What does it depict?  Are there people or objects? What is the significance to the course?)\n* **A chart or graph?** (What data does it show? What are the axes? What conclusions can be drawn?)\n* **A table?** (What information is presented? What are the columns and rows?)\n\nWithout the image itself, any further description would be purely speculative.  Provide the image, and a detailed description can be given.]](https://youtu.be/1H5Aq7HjqwQ)\n\n**Q1: What will be covered in this session?**\n\n**A1:** This session will cover concepts from Week 1 of the graded assignment in Tools in Data Science (TDS). The focus is on guiding students toward solutions, not providing exact answers. Week 2 will be covered in the next session.\n\n**Q2: Is it possible to reschedule the TDS session?**\n\n**A2:** The instructor will check if rescheduling is possible. If not, recordings will be available on YouTube.\n\n**Q3: The first question in the graded assignment is about VS Code. What's involved?**\n\n**A3:** The question focuses on installing VS Code and running a specific command in the terminal, then pasting the output into an input box. There's no significant technical component to this question.\n\n**Q4: What are the benefits of using the UV command-line tool?**\n\n**A4:** UV eliminates the need to create virtual environments. You include small portions of code and run the application with minimal setup.\n\n**Q5: How does UV integrate with VS Code?**\n\n**A5:** There's no integration; UV is used in the command prompt, similar to pip (Python), npm (JavaScript), or Node.js.\n\n**Q6: Are there examples demonstrating UV usage and integration with VS Code?**\n\n**A6:** No specific VS Code integration is needed. UV is used in the command line, like pip or npm. A previous project (Project 2) used UV to automate running 687 student Python submissions, each with unique requirements. Students added metadata to their Python files specifying the Python version and required libraries. UV dynamically handled these requirements for each submission.\n\n**Q7: In the RWE exam, what will the format be like?**\n\n**A7:** The format will be similar to the graded assignments: questions and answer boxes. You can use any tools you want. It's a non-proctored exam. It will cover concepts taught in the course, including new material.\n\n**Q8: In Week 1, do we need to build advanced-level concepts, or will we learn them week by week?**\n\n**A8:** Each week will have different content, including graded assignments. Content links are provided.\n\n**Q9: The UV part of the project was only a 7-minute video. Do we need to learn UV fully in Week 1, or will we learn it in upcoming weeks?**\n\n**A9:** UV is introduced in Week 1. The most useful aspect is embedding everything in inline metadata within the script, eliminating the need for virtual environments.\n\n**Q10: How do we start the project?**\n\n**A10:** There will be separate guidance sessions for the project.\n\n**Q11: Will we get a screen recording of this session?**\n\n**A11:** Yes, the session will be uploaded to YouTube.\n\n**Q12: While putting in the directory for a specific file (e.g., question 2), do you need to provide the full address (drive, etc.)?**\n\n**A12:** It works because the script is executed from the same directory. You need to provide the correct path (relative or absolute).\n\n**Q13: Can you explain the use of DevTools?**\n\n**A13:** Right-click on the browser and select \"Inspect.\" This opens a world of code and information about the website. You can see HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc. You can use the arrow tool to select an element, then modify the code. These changes are only local to your browser.\n\n**Q14: Can you explain the use of the Console tab in DevTools?**\n\n**A14:** The Console tab lets you run JavaScript. This will be covered later in the session, in the context of CSS selectors.\n\n**Q15: Can you explain the Network tab in DevTools?**\n\n**A15:** The Network tab shows all external information the browser is fetching. For TDS, the \"Fetch\" tab is most useful, showing APIs, JSON code, and CSS files. It shows what the website is pulling from the server.\n\n**Q16: Can we modify the content in the Network tab?**\n\n**A16:** No, you can only modify the website's structure in the Elements tab.\n\n**Q17: Can you explain the Network tab again, briefly?**\n\n**A17:** The Network tab shows external information the browser is fetching from where the website is deployed. The \"Fetch\" tab is particularly useful for TDS, showing APIs, JSON, and CSS files.\n\n**Q18: In a later Week 1 question, we need to find values within a specific div class. Will the JavaScript code work on the entire site, or just the specified area?**\n\n**A18:** The JavaScript will work on the entire site because the DOM structure is a tree. However, you can use selectors to target specific elements within that structure.\n\n**Q19: How are HTML and CSS connected? Do we need JavaScript to extract information?**\n\n**A19:** HTML is the skeleton, JavaScript the muscles, and CSS the skin. JavaScript is used to extract information from the HTML code using CSS selectors (classes or IDs).\n\n**Q20: Can you explain the later part of the code used to extract data?**\n\n**A20:** The code uses a map function to iterate through a list of elements. `innerText` gives the text content of an element, while `innerHTML` gives the entire HTML code. `innerText` is generally preferred for data extraction.\n\n**Q21: Are there other commands or attributes besides `innerText`?**\n\n**A21:** Yes, there are other attributes. `text` is similar to `innerText`, but `innerText` is more reliable. Always use `innerText` if `text` doesn't work.\n\n**Q22: How do classes and IDs work in CSS selectors?**\n\n**A22:** Classes are generic and can be applied to multiple elements. IDs are unique to a single element. In CSS selectors, classes are prefixed with a dot (.), and IDs with a hash (#).\n\n**Q23: While showing `innerText`, you used a command that neatly organized the movie list. Why?**\n\n**A23:** The console organizes the output for readability, packing items into groups of 100. Otherwise, it would be a single, long array.\n\n**Q24: How can I copy the entire list from the console?**\n\n**A24:** Enclose the code in a `copy()` function. This copies the output to your clipboard.\n\n**Q25: Does the developer tool only work on Chrome?**\n\n**A25:** It works on Edge and other browsers. In Safari or Mozilla, right-click anywhere on the webpage and look for the \"Inspect\" option.\n\n**Q26: Can we modify the content in the Network tab?**\n\n**A26:** No, you can only modify the website's structure in the Elements tab. The Network tab shows what the browser is fetching, not what you can change.\n\n**Q27: Can you explain the use of classes in more detail?**\n\n**A27:** Classes allow you to apply CSS to your code. If you remove a class, the associated CSS styling is removed. Classes can be applied to multiple elements, while IDs are unique to a single element.\n\n**Q28: Can we limit JavaScript selection to a specific chunk of HTML data?**\n\n**A28:** No, JavaScript will work on the entire site unless you use selectors to target specific elements.\n\n**Q29: What is the origin of the exercise to extract names from the meeting participants?**\n\n**A29:** The instructor created this exercise to encourage participation. A random participant is selected to answer a question.\n\n**Q30: Can we go back to the syntax we typed?**\n\n**A30:** The syntax was `$$(\".className\").map(...)`. The `$$` selects elements with the specified class, and `map` iterates through them. The instructor demonstrates how to extract the movie names using this. The instructor also explains the difference between `innerText` and `innerHTML`. `innerText` returns only the text, while `innerHTML` returns the entire HTML code. `innerText` is generally preferred for data extraction. If `text` doesn't work, use `innerText`.\n\n**Q31: Should the `innerText` be written exactly as it appears, or can we modify the case (e.g., make \"T\" lowercase)?**\n\n**A31:** Use the text exactly as it appears.\n\n**Q32: What is the role of npx in this context?**\n\n**A32:** npx creates a separate environment for a project, installing dependencies locally without affecting other projects. It's an alternative to npm, which installs globally.\n\n**Q33: Does npx run primarily on Linux?**\n\n**A33:** npx works on both PowerShell and Bash, but sha256sum might not work on Windows. You can run the npx command separately and use sha256sum on the resulting file.\n\n**Q34: While showing `innerText`, you made the movie list extremely neat. Why?**\n\n**A34:** That's how the console presents the data, organizing it into groups of 100 for readability.\n\n**Q35: How can I copy the entire list from the console?**\n\n**A35:** Use the `copy()` function in the console to copy the output to your clipboard.\n\n**Q36: What should we focus on when using the Elements, Console, and Network tabs?**\n\n**A36:** For the Elements tab, focus on extracting data using CSS selectors (classes and IDs). The Console tab is used for running JavaScript, particularly for data scraping with CSS selectors. The Network tab shows what the browser is fetching. The instructor recommends exploring these tabs and having fun with them.\n",

Without more context, its meaning is unclear.\n\nTo assist a student, we need the *actual* image.  The alt text only provides organizational information about its place within a larger set of learning materials.]](https://youtu.be/hG5WqtbpfkI)\n\n**Q1: How to solve question number 7 (counting Wednesdays between two dates)?**\n\n**A1:** Use Excel. Input the two dates into two cells. Use a command to find the difference in days, then divide by 7 to get the number of weeks. Since there's one Wednesday per week, that's the number of Wednesdays. If the start date isn't a Wednesday, a different approach is needed.\n\n**Q2: How to handle dates that don't start on a Wednesday?**\n\n**A2:** Instead of starting from the given date, start from the next day (e.g., if it starts on Tuesday, start on Wednesday). Calculate the difference in days and divide by 7. The method of simply dividing by 7 might not always give the correct answer, so the logic needs to be adjusted based on the starting day. Another approach is to start from the nearest Wednesday and iterate using a while loop, but this is less efficient.\n\n**Q3: How to extract a CSV file from a zip file?**\n\n**A3:** This is considered a basic task. Use a file explorer or command-line tools. The instructor skips this question.\n\n**Q4: What is JSON and how is it used?**\n\n**A4:** JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a way to store data, like names and ages of students or employees. It uses key-value pairs. The instructor demonstrates creating a JSON object in Python, showing how to access elements using indexing and nested structures. JSON can also be used in JavaScript and browser consoles.\n\n**Q5: How can I access data from a JSON object?**\n\n**A5:** The instructor shows how to access elements within a JSON object using indexing in Python. For example, to access the name of the third student in a list, you would use `students[2][name]`. JSON allows hierarchical data storage, making it easy to retrieve specific values.\n\n**Q6: How does JSON get loaded on a website (e.g., Discourse)?**\n\n**A6:** Websites often fetch JSON data from backend servers. The instructor shows an example on the Discourse website, where different data (weekly, yearly) is loaded based on the request parameters in the URL. Multiple filters can be added to the URL to refine the data fetched.\n\n**Q7: How can I use Python to access JSON data from a URL?**\n\n**A7:** The instructor demonstrates using the `requests` library in Python to fetch JSON data from a URL. The response status code (e.g., 200 for success) indicates whether the request was successful. The JSON data is then accessible as a Python dictionary. The instructor uses Postman to show how to send API requests and view the JSON response.\n\n**Q8: What is Postman and how does it work?**\n\n**A8:** Postman is a tool that acts as an intermediary between you and an API. It sends API calls and retrieves the data. Alternatively, the Thunder Client extension in VS Code can be used for the same purpose.\n\n**Q9: What are CSS selectors and combinators?**\n\n**A9:** The instructor explains CSS selectors and combinators, focusing on basic selectors and the direct child combinator (`>`) which selects only direct children of an element. More advanced combinators are mentioned but not covered in detail.\n\n**Q10: How to handle large JSON objects or datasets?**\n\n**A10:** For large datasets, copying and pasting is impractical. Instead, use Python and API calls to fetch and process the data programmatically. This avoids overwhelming the browser and allows for automation.\n\n**Q11: How to handle encoding issues when opening CSV files?**\n\n**A11:** When opening CSV files, especially those with unusual characters, specify the correct encoding (e.g., using the `encoding` parameter in pandas). The instructor shows how to detect the encoding of a file using Python and then uses pandas to open the file with the detected encoding.\n\n**Q12: How to use Git and GitHub?**\n\n**A12:** The instructor suggests covering Git and GitHub in a separate session due to the complexity and time required for a thorough explanation.\n\n**Q13: How to use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) in VS Code?**\n\n**A13:** The instructor explains how to use the WSL extension in VS Code to access a Linux terminal within VS Code. This is useful for running bash commands. The instructor notes that the default terminal in a Mac might not support all commands, so WSL is an alternative.\n\n**Q14: Why does the course feel overwhelming?**\n\n**A14:** The instructor acknowledges that the course challenges students' logical thinking by introducing concepts and tools not previously taught. The instructor encourages students to use ChatGPT to help bridge knowledge gaps and emphasizes that the course aims to build a strong foundation and encourage exploration beyond the curriculum. The instructor also points out that the course materials are available in the course portal, including content for weeks beyond the current one. A feedback form is provided for students to report challenges and suggest improvements.\n",

The alt text simply provides a framework for understanding when and where the image was used within a course.]](https://youtu.be/aJnygTpma7M)\n\n**Q1: What is an ML project, and how does it compare to the \"fitting of six models\" project?**\n\n**A1:** An ML (Machine Learning) project involves more factors than just fitting models. The \"fitting of six models\" project was a simplified version done for a friend's certification course. It involved training six models on a pre-cleaned dataset with some hyperparameter tuning but minimal data preprocessing or cleaning.\n\n**Q2: Is the TDS project designed to provide a level playing field for everyone, considering some participants may lack coding experience?**\n\n**A2:** The TDS project aims to combine everything learned in the course so far. It might seem challenging, especially for those without a coding background. The project requires creating an application with specific endpoints, pushing it to GitHub, creating a Docker file, and submitting it through a Google form. However, the course is designed to bridge the technical gap for non-technical participants, preparing them for industry standards. The instructors will provide support through dedicated sessions, and students are encouraged to use resources like ChatGPT and YouTube videos.\n\n**Q3: What are the main components of the TDS project, and what tools are involved?**\n\n**A3:** The TDS project has three main parts:\n\n1. **GitHub:** For version control and code storage.\n2. **Docker Hub:** For containerizing and deploying the application.\n3. **LLM (Large Language Model):** For the core functionality of the application.\n   The project involves using Fast API or similar frameworks to create the application, Podman to run the Docker image, and a form to submit the GitHub and Docker file details.\n\n**Q4: How does the project accommodate participants from non-science or non-coding backgrounds?**\n\n**A4:** The course aims to equip all participants, regardless of their background, with the necessary skills for the industry. It provides support through live sessions, encourages the use of external resources like ChatGPT and YouTube, and offers dedicated project sessions. The goal is to bridge the technical gap and prepare everyone for real-world challenges.\n\n**Q5: How can I seek help or clarification on the project, especially if I find it overwhelming?**\n\n**A5:** You can ask questions during the live sessions, utilize the course forum, or reach out to the instructors directly through the designated channels. Additionally, you can use resources like ChatGPT for assistance.\n\n**Q6: What are the key tools and technologies used in the TDS project?**\n\n**A6:** Key tools include Git for version control, GitHub for code hosting, Docker for containerization, Podman for running Docker images, and Fast API (or similar frameworks) for creating the application.\n\n**Q7: How can I use VS Code for managing my Git repository?**\n\n**A7:** VS Code has extensions that simplify Git operations. You can initialize a new Git instance, connect it to a remote GitHub repository, commit changes with messages, and manage branches all within the VS Code interface.\n\n**Q8: How can I handle case-insensitive replacements in files using command-line tools?**\n\n**A8:** You can use the `sed` editor with the `-i` option for in-place editing and the `I` flag for case-insensitive matching. You can combine this with `find` to locate and modify multiple files within a directory structure.\n\n**Q9: How do I set up the connection between my local Git instance and a remote GitHub repository?**\n\n**A9:** You can use the `git remote add origin <repository URL>` command to establish the connection. You can find the specific URL on the GitHub repository page.\n\n**Q10: What if I encounter issues while trying to push changes to GitHub?**\n\n**A10:** If you're using HTTPS, you'll need to use a personal access token instead of your password for authentication. If you encounter errors, ensure you have configured your Git username and email correctly using `git config`. You might also need to check the permissions granted to your personal access token or set up SSH keys for authentication.\n\n**Q11: How many students are regularly attending the live sessions?**\n\n**A11:** The attendance in the live sessions is lower than expected, with around 15-25 students at peak times, compared to the 400-500 enrolled in the current term.\n\n**Q12: What is the new feature added for TDS live sessions?**\n\n**A12:** A new feature has been added that curates the live sessions into a few important portions, providing a summary of the questions asked and their answers. This allows students who missed a session to quickly catch up on the key topics discussed.\n\n**Q13: When is the next session scheduled, and will it clash with college classes?**\n\n**A13:** The next session is scheduled for 5 PM. There might be clashes with college classes, as the schedule is pre-planned with classes on Tuesdays from 5-7 PM, Wednesdays from 9-10 AM, and other classes from 8-10 PM.\n\n**Q14: Where can I find the link for the new feature summarizing live sessions?**\n\n**A14:** The link has been emailed to all participants and can also be found at the very bottom of the course page.\n\n**Q15: How can I get support regarding any particular topic in the project?**\n\n**A15:** You can use the \"Learning Feedback\" form on the portal to submit your queries related to specific modules or topics. The responses are used to plan future sessions.\n\n**Q16: What is GitHub, and how is it used in the project?**\n\n**A16:** GitHub is a platform for hosting Git repositories. It allows for version control, collaboration, and code sharing. In the project, you will push your code to a GitHub repository, making it accessible to others and enabling collaboration.\n\n**Q17: What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**\n\n**A17:** Git is a version control system that you install and use on your local machine, while GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories, allowing for remote collaboration and code sharing.\n\n**Q18: What are the alternatives to using command-line tools for Git and GitHub operations?**\n\n**A18:** You can use a graphical interface like VS Code with Git extensions to manage your Git repositories and interact with GitHub. This can be more user-friendly than using command-line tools.\n\n**Q19: How does the `sed` editor work for replacing text in files?**\n\n**A19:** The `sed` editor is a stream editor that can perform text transformations on input streams. You can use it with the `s` command for substitution, specifying the pattern to match and the replacement text. The `g` flag indicates global replacement (all occurrences), and the `I` flag enables case-insensitive matching.\n\n**Q1: How can I use the `find` command to locate files for processing with `sed`?**\n\n**A21:** The `find` command can locate files based on various criteria, such as name, type, and location. You can use the `-exec` option to execute a command, like `sed`, on each file found. For example, `find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/IITM/IIT Madras/gI' {} \\;` will find all files in the current directory and its subdirectories and replace \"IITM\" with \"IIT Madras\" (case-insensitive) in each file.\n\n**Q22: Why am I getting an \"authentication failed\" error when pushing to GitHub?**\n\n**A22:** This could be because GitHub no longer supports password authentication for Git operations. You need to use a personal access token or set up SSH keys for authentication.\n\n**Q23: How do I create and use a personal access token for GitHub authentication?**\n\n**A23:** You can create a personal access token in your GitHub account settings under \"Developer settings.\" When pushing to GitHub, use your GitHub username and the generated token instead of your password.\n\n**Q24: How do I set up SSH keys for GitHub authentication?**\n\n**A24:** You can generate SSH keys using the `ssh-keygen` command and then add the public key to your GitHub account settings. This allows you to authenticate without using a password or personal access token.\n\n**Q25: What is the purpose of the `git remote add origin` command?**\n\n**A25:** This command adds a remote repository named \"origin\" to your local Git instance. \"Origin\" is a conventional name for the primary remote repository, and the URL specifies the location of the remote repository on GitHub.\n\n**Q26: How can I update the remote URL if I have already added one?**\n\n**A26:** You can update the remote URL using the `git remote set-url origin <new URL>` command, replacing `<new URL>` with the correct URL of your GitHub repository.\n\n**Q27: What is the difference between committing and pushing in Git?**\n\n**A27:** Committing saves changes to your local Git instance, while pushing uploads those committed changes to a remote repository like GitHub.\n\n**Q28: How can I use VS Code to simplify Git operations?**\n\n**A28:** VS Code has built-in Git integration and extensions that provide a graphical interface for managing your repository. You can stage changes, commit them with messages, push to remote repositories, manage branches, and perform other Git operations without using the command line.\n\n**Q29: What is the significance of the `.git` folder in my project directory?**\n\n**A29:** The `.git` folder is a hidden directory that contains all the information related to your Git instance, including the history of commits, branches, and other metadata. It's essential for version control and should not be modified directly.\n\n**Q30: How can I ensure that my code is backed up and accessible to collaborators?**\n\n**A30:** By pushing your code to a remote GitHub repository, you create a backup of your project and make it accessible to collaborators who have been granted access. This ensures that your code is safe even if your local machine encounters issues.\n",

The image might be:\n\n* **A slide from a presentation:**  Showing a title slide, an outline, data points, or a diagram relevant to the TDS topic.\n* **A handout or worksheet:** Containing exercises, questions, or information related to the session.\n* **A graph or chart:** Visualizing data related to the TDS topic.\n* **A photograph:**  Perhaps illustrating a concept being discussed in the session.\n\n\nWithout seeing the image, any further description is impossible.  Students should provide the image itself for a detailed explanation.]](https://youtu.be/0e0RhXREnxU)\n\n**Q1: How much depth of knowledge is needed for the tools in the TDS course, specifically for GA1 and GA2?**\n\n**A1:** The goal is to give you sufficient proficiency to execute the purpose of the tools, not to make you an expert. The focus is on GA1 and GA2 because of the approaching deadline. Basic knowledge will suffice; how deep you go is up to you. The biggest challenge is usually reading and understanding documentation. These sessions are designed to help you overcome that hurdle.\n\n**Q2: What is the tool to create the API?**\n\n**A2:** FastAPI. It will be demonstrated in this session.\n\n**Q3: Will there be a review of the previous sessions?**\n\n**A3:** Recordings are available on the YouTube playlist. Summaries are also available on the Tools in Data Science website (the last item on the page). The summaries were generated using AI, and the process is explained. An overarching summary may be added later, but not today.\n\n**Q4: In the week 2 GA assignment, when using FastAPI, question 9 asks for an authentication tool from NGrok. After three uses, it says the limitation has expired. What can we do?**\n\n**A4:** NGrok will be discussed in this session. The limitation is that you can only run one server or one tunnel at a time.\n\n**Q5: In the GitHub Actions section, question 7 asks about creating a FastAPI webpage using GitHub. It seems to require a premium version. Is there a workaround?**\n\n**A5:** You can do it without a premium version. The only time you might have an issue is if you're using Codespaces and run out of the 125-hour limitation. Students have free access to GitHub.\n\n**Q6: What is the tool to create the API?**\n\n**A6:** FastAPI.\n\n**Q7: Are the scores from the initial check (9/10 or 10/10) final, or will they be evaluated after submission?**\n\n**A7:** Whatever you last submitted is your final score.\n\n**Q8: In GA1, question 2 says to submit only the JSON body, not the headers. But if I don't submit headers, it shows an error. What should I do?**\n\n**A8:** This will be addressed toward the end of the session.\n\n**Q9: When running UVicorn on WSL, there are no issues. But on Windows, it seems there's an issue with anti-something, some shielders, or something on my computer, flagging it and preventing it from running. What should I do?**\n\n**A9:** Most web infrastructure runs on Linux servers (maybe 80%). These tools are designed with Linux in mind, and later ported to Windows. There will be some issues running them on Windows. You can get Linux in Windows now using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). You need at least 8 GB of RAM to run it with reasonable performance. Anything less won't work or will work poorly. If you can, install WSL; it's worth it. Then these tools will work out of the box.\n\n**Q10: What is CI/CD?**\n\n**A10:** Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment. It automates tasks such as compiling, running, and sending code to devices. It reduces the time lag between finding a bug, fixing it, and pushing the fix to the devices that need it. This is useful in data science when pulling data from various places and quickly integrating findings into a workflow.\n\n**Q11: What is Vercel?**\n\n**A11:** Vercel is a platform to deploy applications. You can deploy quickly and easily, and it automatically rebuilds when you push an update. You can deploy directly from your GitHub repo.\n\n**Q12: What is the difference between Docker run and Docker compose?**\n\n**A12:** Docker compose is for local testing. You can create a local network, give it a name, and test with four or five containers. For larger deployments, use Swarm (provided by Docker), Kubernetes, or Mesos.\n\n**Q13: Can we wrap our MAD1 and MAD2 projects using Docker?**\n\n**A13:** Yes, that's possible.\n\n**Q14: Is there a demo where all the tools are used in a single project?**\n\n**A14:** There will be a separate session for the project, towards the end of this week or the beginning of next week. This session will show how all the tools fit together.\n\n**Q15: If someone goes through CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, and REST API, will that cover 50% of the course?**\n\n**A15:** Yes, roughly. The core technologies (REST APIs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS) haven't changed much in 30 years. Learning these will give you a foundation to learn other tools more easily. The course will also spend significant time on LLMs and how they fit into the workflow.\n",

It provides contextual information:\n\n* **2025-01-22:** This is the date the image was likely created or is relevant to.  It's January 22nd, 2025.\n* **Week 2:** This indicates the image is part of a course or learning program, and it's from the second week of that program.\n* **Session 3:** This suggests the image belongs to the third session within week two.\n* **TDS Jan 25:** This likely refers to a specific topic, deadline, or event (\"TDS\") scheduled for January 25th, 2025.  The exact meaning of \"TDS\" requires further context (e.g., it could be an abbreviation for a subject, assignment, or meeting).\n\n**Without seeing the image itself, it's impossible to describe its contents.**  The alt text only provides the scheduling and administrative details related to the image's placement within a larger educational framework. To help a student, we need to know *what the image depicts*.  Is it a diagram, a chart, a photograph, a drawing?  What is its purpose within the session?]](https://youtu.be/QnLi-C_LiXk)\n\n**Q1: What are the essential base technologies to learn for the TDS course?**\n\n**A1:** Focus on these three areas: 1) Bash and shell scripting; 2) Git; 3) CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Also, learn REST APIs. Other tools can be learned on the go once you have a basic understanding of these core technologies.\n\n**Q2: Regarding the tools and techniques needed for the TDS course, are Bash and shell scripting, Git, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and REST APIs the only essential ones?**\n\n**A2:** Yes, those are the core technologies. Other tools are supplementary and can be learned as needed throughout the course. The instructor suggests a three-part approach to learning: 1) Define the purpose; 2) Determine the technique; 3) Select the tools.\n\n**Q3: In short, is it sufficient to learn the listed technologies to a certain depth, not necessarily to the level of a diploma?**\n\n**A3:** Yes, learning to a certain depth is sufficient. The learning process should always be purpose-driven. You don't need to become an expert in any one tool; you need to know how to use it to accomplish your task.\n\n**Q4: For the last two questions in Week 2 (the Llama file and the Docker file), do we need to install the applications or can we do it online?**\n\n**A4:** For the Llama file, you don't need to download anything. For the Docker file, you can use online tools like Google Colab, which provides a Linux environment. You can run Docker directly in Colab.\n\n**Q5: I deployed a project via GitHub, but I'm getting a 404 error. Why?**\n\n**A5:** A 404 error means the page isn't found. The instructor suggests posting a screenshot and your email ID on the Discourse forum for more detailed debugging.\n\n**Q6: In the Llama file question, the URL shows the correct answer initially, but after refreshing, it shows an incorrect answer. Why?**\n\n**A6:** Post a screenshot and your email ID on the Discourse forum. This will allow the instructor to check the backend and the script to determine the cause.\n\n**Q7: Are the graded assignments open internet or closed internet?**\n\n**A7:** All graded assignments are open internet, except for the final in-person exam, which is closed internet.\n\n**Q8: I'm having trouble signing into GitHub with my IIT email. Is GitHub only available for personal emails?**\n\n**A8:** GitHub is available for any email. You need to sign up first, then sign in. For evaluation purposes, your submissions will be linked to the email address you use to log in. The instructor recommends signing up with your IIT email.\n\n**Q9: For the GitHub question, if I've signed in with a personal ID but also have an IIT ID, will that be a problem?**\n\n**A9:** There shouldn't be a problem. The instructor recommends using your IIT email for evaluation purposes.\n\n**Q10: In the graded assignment 2, image compression, I'm getting an error: \"Could not process the image. Is it browser supported? Image pixels do not match the original.\" I've tried several ways, including using Photoshop to ensure the image resolution is the same. What's wrong?**\n\n**A10:** The image size should be less than 1,300,000 bytes. The instructor will make a note of this issue and investigate. The error may be browser-related, so trying a different browser might help. The instructor also requests the Discourse link be shared.\n\n**Q11: For the TDS project, do we have to choose the project, or will it be added to our course by default?**\n\n**A11:** The TDS project is part of the course and will be automatically added. It's not a separate project like in other courses.\n\n**Q12: Should I be worried that the evaluation scripts might be updated after I submit my answers, potentially changing my grade?**\n\n**A12:** No, the evaluation scripts are updated to address additional corner cases, but the randomization of questions means that the changes are unlikely to affect your grade. The instructor suggests checking your answers again using GA2 as an exercise.\n\n**Q13: How will we submit Project 1? Will it be via Google Form?**\n\n**A13:** Yes, Project 1 will be submitted via Google Form. The deliverable will be a GitHub repository.\n\n**Q14: I'm using Windows, but many questions require Ubuntu. I copied the downloaded files to my WSL home folder, but I'm not getting the correct answers. Is it possible to install a Windows system in Linux?**\n\n**A14:** You can use WSL. The instructor asks for a screenshot to debug the issue. The student explains that they copied the files (a.txt and b.txt) to a TDS folder in their Ubuntu WSL environment. The `diff` command shows 40 lines of difference, but the submission is not accepted. The instructor suggests posting this on the Discourse forum.\n\n**Q15: Question 16 in GA1 (rename files) is not accepting my answer, even though I've tried using ChatGPT. What's wrong?**\n\n**A15:** The instructor suggests posting this on the Discourse forum with your email ID. The instructor notes that many submissions are randomized, so the issue may be related to the specific randomized version of the question.\n",

It tells us the following:\n\n* **Date Created:** January 23rd, 2025\n* **Week in Course:** Week 3 of a course or program.\n* **Session Number:** Session 4 within Week 3.\n* **Topic/Abbreviation:** \"TDS\" likely refers to a specific topic or subject abbreviation relevant to the course.  Without knowing the course content, we can't definitively say what TDS stands for (e.g., Tax Deduction at Source, Total Dissolved Solids, etc.).\n* **Date of Session:** The session itself was on January 25th, 2025.  This suggests the image might be a handout, slide, or other visual aid prepared *before* the session.\n\n**To help a student, we need to see the actual image.**  The alt text only provides contextual information.  To describe the image itself for student assistance, we'd need to know:\n\n* **What type of image is it?** (Photograph, diagram, chart, graph, etc.)\n* **What is depicted in the image?**  (Concepts, data, processes, etc.)\n* **What are the key elements or features of the image?** (Labels, captions, data points, etc.)\n\nOnce the image is provided, a detailed description can be given, helping students understand its educational value in the context of \"Week 3, Session 4, TDS.\"]](https://youtu.be/TxGY540ru3A)\n\n**Q1: How can I compare two files using the command line?**\n\n**A1:** You can use the `diff` command in bash, or the `git diff` command if you've initialized a git repository. The `diff` command shows the differences between two files directly. `git diff` compares commits in a git repository.\n\n**Q2: I'm having trouble viewing my GA1. It's showing zero ones. Can you help?**\n\n**A2:** Let's look at your screen. It appears there are different timestamps. I'll help you troubleshoot.\n\n**Q3: How can I move files from multiple subfolders into a single folder using the command line?**\n\n**A3:** I used a bash script that combines the `find` command (to locate files of a specific type, like `.txt` files) and the `mv` command (to move them). The `find` command searches the current directory (`./`) for files (`-type f`) and the `-exec` option executes the `mv` command on each file found. The curly braces `{}` are placeholders for the filenames.\n\n**Q4: Will knowing only six SQL commands (SELECT, FROM, GROUP BY, etc.) be enough to complete this course?**\n\n**A4:** You'll only need basic SQL for this course, mainly for extracting data. We're not covering a full DBMS course. A good resource to learn more is SQLZoo. While you might not need more than six commands for this course, ChatGPT can help if you encounter more complex SQL queries.\n\n**Q5: How can I deploy a Flask application to Vercel?**\n\n**A5:** First, set up a git repository and connect it to your GitHub account. Then, create a virtual environment for your Python project using `python -m venv <env_name>`. Activate it using the appropriate script (e.g., `.\\env\\Scripts\\activate`). Install Flask using `pip install flask`. Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude the virtual environment folder. Then, create a `vercel.json` file with build instructions for Vercel. Commit and push your code to GitHub. Finally, add your project to Vercel, selecting the correct repository and build settings (Python, not Node). Vercel will automatically redeploy your application whenever you push changes to GitHub. This is called CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment).\n\n**Q6: What does the port number matter when deploying to Vercel?**\n\n**A6:** When deploying to Vercel, the port number you use locally doesn't matter because Vercel will assign your application its own domain. You should remove `debug=True` from your Flask application before deploying to production.\n\n**Q7: Why do I need administrator permissions to use ngrok?**\n\n**A7:** ngrok is a command-line tool that forwards requests to your local host. It doesn't need to be installed in your virtual environment. However, you might need administrator privileges to forward requests through a port. If you encounter permission issues, try running PowerShell as administrator.\n\n**Q8: What is ngrok and how does it work?**\n\n**A8:** ngrok creates a public URL that forwards requests to your locally running application. This allows anyone on the internet to access your application, even though it's running on your local machine. Your computer acts as a server. Note that ngrok only works while your local server is running. For a permanent solution, deploy to a platform like Vercel or Netlify.\n\n**Q9: What is a virtual environment and why is it useful?**\n\n**A9:** A virtual environment creates a separate, isolated environment for your project. This prevents conflicts between different project dependencies. Think of it like creating a separate section in a swimming pool for a child, where the depth is less than the main pool. You can install libraries (like Flask and Pandas) within the virtual environment without affecting your global Python packages.\n\n**Q10: What is the assignment?**\n\n**A10:** Create a Flask application that takes a user's birth month as input and returns their zodiac sign. This is a fun exercise to improve your Flask skills. You can deploy it to Vercel or Netlify and share the link. Remember to create a `.gitignore` file to exclude the virtual environment folder.\n",

The student should provide the image itself for a detailed description.]](https://youtu.be/lmSMQ5LWa30)\n\n**Q1: Can I ask a question about the graded assignment for week one?**\n\n**A1:** I'll try to answer it at the end of the session if there's time. We'll also have extra sessions this week, and we're hoping to release video solutions showing how to solve some of the assignments. But for now, let's focus on today's session.\n\n**Q2: I posted a question on the Discourse forum about the assignment. Should I ask it again now?**\n\n**A2:** No need to ask it again. I'll look at the forum later.\n\n**Q3: DeepSeek is in the news. Does that affect the course?**\n\n**A3:** Not really. The core concept remains the same: using LLMs as agents. The workflow is similar whether you use OpenAI, Anthropic, Copilot, or other AI tools.\n\n**Q4: What is the concept behind Project One?**\n\n**A4:** Project One involves creating an automated continuous integration pipeline. Data comes into a server, and various tasks are performed, many of which are repetitive. The goal is to automate some of this process to reduce errors and produce structured output. Your job is to build an API that handles these tasks using an LLM.\n\n**Q5: What kind of tasks can I expect?**\n\n**A5:** There are roughly 10 tasks in Phase A, which should be straightforward. In Phase B, the tasks are less well-defined, testing your system's ability to handle unexpected requests. The API should have two endpoints: \"run\" and \"read\". The \"run\" endpoint receives a task description (in plain English), processes it, and creates output files. The \"read\" endpoint retrieves the contents of a specified file.\n\n**Q6: In GA1, the videos and questions aren't showing after the submission deadline. Can they be shown?**\n\n**A6:** I'll inform Anand. The videos should still be available on the Tools in Data Science portal. They're from this section.\n\n**Q7: Why are the videos and questions integrated into the GA itself?**\n\n**A7:** Based on past data, students often go straight to the assignments without reviewing the content. Integrating the content into the GA is a better way to ensure they see it.\n\n**Q8: I'm struggling with the project. The concepts are confusing. Could you present a model project and explain things step-by-step?**\n\n**A8:** Yes, we'll do that in future sessions. We'll work through a working prototype of the project to illustrate each step. The project only uses material from the first three weeks of the course. If you're thorough with that material, you should be able to complete the project. It seems there's a knowledge gap, but I have full faith you can handle it. We'll address that gap in future sessions, starting with the basics.\n\n**Q9: I'm having trouble with Git and GitHub. Is there support available?**\n\n**A9:** Yes, we'll provide as much support as possible. We'll also go through a working prototype in future sessions. If you're struggling with Git, you won't be able to do the project, as it's a prerequisite. We'll create a repository during a future session so you can see how it's done.\n\n**Q10: What's required for grading?**\n\n**A10:** Your repository must meet these criteria:\n\n- It must exist and be publicly accessible.\n- It must have a license file (MIT license).\n- It must have a valid Dockerfile.\n- The Docker image must be publicly accessible and run via the specified command.\n- The Docker image must use the same Dockerfile as your GitHub repository.\n\nIt doesn't have to be publicly accessible while you're developing it. Just make sure it's public when you submit. These are absolute prerequisites; if any fail, your project won't be evaluated.\n\n**Q11: What is the grading scheme?**\n\n**A11:** Phase A is worth 10 marks, and Phase B is worth 10 marks. You get one mark for each task completed in Phase A and one for each task in Phase B. There are also bonus marks for additional tasks and code diversity. Last term, there were 12 bonus marks, and the highest score was 7 or 8 out of 12.\n\n**Q12: We give bonuses for code diversity. Does that mean we penalize copying?**\n\n**A12:** No, we don't penalize copying. We want you to learn. We encourage you to learn from each other, but we'll reward unique code.\n\n**Q13: How do I use the OpenAI LLM?**\n\n**A13:** You'll use it through a proxy. You'll get a $1 limit per month, renewed at the beginning of each month. Avoid exceeding this limit by carefully constructing your queries. We'll show you how to use environment variables to avoid putting your token directly in your code.\n\n**Q14: How do I get access to Perplexity AI?**\n\n**A14:** All IITM students (including BS students) have free access to the Pro version of Perplexity AI for one year. Use your IITM email address to register.\n\n**Q15: In the LLM section, the prompt engineering section mentions using the API a certain number of times. I haven't used it even once. The key was generated, but I didn't use it. What should I do?**\n\n**A15:** We'll cover this in a later session.\n\n**Q16: The textbox in question 3 doesn't appear. I think there's a CSS issue. I generated the JSON, but it's not being accepted. Should I refresh?**\n\n**A16:** We'll cover this in a later session.\n\n**Q17: There was mention of a debrief session on the project. I couldn't find the video. Is there one?**\n\n**A17:** Yes, at the beginning of this session, we discussed the requirements for Project One. We'll upload this video in a few hours or early tomorrow.\n\n**Q18: Will there be support for those not well-versed in Git and GitHub?**\n\n**A18:** Yes, we'll provide support. We'll also go through a working prototype in future sessions.\n\n**Q19: Is the week two content completely covered in the sessions?**\n\n**A19:** Yes, but the way we covered it is a bit different. We went through the important parts. Referencing past sessions will give you a concise idea of the important parts.\n\n**Q20: I have a question about GA1, questions 10 and 11. I posted them on Discourse, but haven't received a reply. In question 10, the hash button is showing an error. In question 11, I don't understand the statement about the class in the hidden element below. What does this line mean?**\n\n**A20:** Regarding question 10, you have to use inverted double quotes for the key and value in the JSON file. Regarding question 11, you need to right-click and inspect the element to find the class name. The data value should be 35.\n\n**Q21: So, for this one, I don't get anything. Did I do it correctly? Should I submit anything else?**\n\n**A21:** You just say \"yes\" here, and then submit to the URL. It will only pick up the API itself. Remove the question mark.\n\n**Q22: Why isn't it reflecting?**\n\n**A22:** It may be because you haven't pushed to GitHub yet.\n\n**Q23: I have a question about prompt engineering. It mentions using the API a certain number of times. I haven't used it, but it generated a key. Can I proceed?**\n\n**A23:** No, you don't need to use the API multiple times. The free OpenAI API access is only through the proxy. A normal OpenAI account is a subscription service and doesn't give you API access. You have to buy tokens to use the API.\n\n**Q24: I've used a normal OpenAI account before. I was hoping to use those model IDs. Why can't I?**\n\n**A24:** The free OpenAI account doesn't give you API access. You can only use their web-based service. To use the API, you have to buy tokens.\n\n**Q25: Can you show me how to do that? Can I share my screen?**\n\n**A25:** No need to share your screen. I'll show you how to access the API via the proxy. That's how your project will have to work.\n\n**Q26: The ninth question in the prompt engineering section mentions paying money. Do I have to pay?**\n\n**A26:** No, you don't have to pay.\n\n**Q27: I have a few more questions. Will we have more sessions before GA3 is due?**\n\n**A27:** Yes, we'll have at least three more sessions before GA3 is due.\n\n**Q28: I thought GA3 was due this weekend. Is that wrong?**\n\n**A28:** Yes, it's due this weekend, but we'll have three more sessions before then.\n\n**Q29: I have another question. Is it okay to ask now?**\n\n**A29:** Sure.\n\n**Q30: I submitted my answers, but I don't know if I did it correctly. There's nothing to submit here. I just say \"yes\"?**\n\n**A30:** You just say \"yes\" and submit to the URL. It will pick up the API itself.\n\n**Q31: Why isn't it reflecting?**\n\n**A31:** It may be because you haven't pushed to GitHub yet.\n\n**Q32: I have a question about GA1, questions 10 and 11. I posted them on Discourse, but haven't received a reply. In question 10, the hash button is showing an error. In question 11, I don't understand the statement about the class in the hidden element below. What does this line mean?**\n\n**A32:** For question 10, you need to use inverted double quotes for the key and value in the JSON file. For question 11, you need to right-click and inspect the element to find the class name. The data value should be 35.\n\n**Q33: What are some other core concepts that are important to understand?**\n\n**A33:** Before I talk about those, let's start with a simple example of how to make an API call to an LLM. API calls are powerful because you can use them in your programs.\n\n**Q34: How do I get my API key?**\n\n**A34:** You can find the link to get your proxy token on the GitHub page. I'll demonstrate using this proxy, but you can use something similar for other LLMs.\n\n**Q35: What is a proxy?**\n\n**A35:** OpenAI provides the service, but you don't interact with them directly. Anand has purchased tokens from OpenAI and provides access via a proxy. The proxy acts as a middleman between you and OpenAI.\n\n**Q36: How many tokens does a prompt take?**\n\n**A36:** The prompt we used took 32 tokens. The response (\"negative\") took two tokens. The total was 34 tokens. This cost us 1/10,000 of a dollar. Keep track of your token usage.\n\n**Q37: How can I keep track of token usage?**\n\n**A37:** Keep track of the prompt and the cost in a file. This will help you be efficient.\n\n**Q38: How are API calls made?**\n\n**A38:** You'll need a URL, headers (including authorization), and a JSON payload. The payload includes the model, messages, and response format. The response format should be strictly defined to avoid unexpected output.\n\n**Q39: Can you share the notebook file?**\n\n**A39:** No, we don't typically share the notebook file itself, as it prevents you from fully grasping the concepts. However, a sample file is available.\n\n**Q40: What about function calling?**\n\n**A40:** We'll cover function calling in a later session. It's a key part of the project. Function calling allows your LLM to decide which function to call based on the prompt. We'll use last term's Project Two to demonstrate.\n\n**Q41: What about embeddings?**\n\n**A41:** Embeddings are another important topic. They reduce the cost of using tokens by an order of magnitude. You can download embeddings from Hugging Face. We'll demonstrate this in a future session.\n\n**Q42: What about text extraction?**\n\n**A42:** We'll cover this in a future session.\n\n**Q43: What about Base64 encoding?**\n\n**A43:** We'll cover this in a future session. It's how you send images to the API.\n\n**Q44: I've seen students use the LLM to get answers to Quiz One. Can I do that?**\n\n**A44:** Yes, you can upload a screenshot of the question and ask the LLM for the answer and explanation. You would send it as a Base64 encoded URI. We'll cover this in a future session.\n\n**Q45: Can we simply go through the topics mentioned (prompt engineering, TDS, TA instructions, LLM sentiment analysis) during self-study?**\n\n**A45:** Yes, but this content is simplified. Reading through documentation is difficult, so we've put this together for you. We'll also demonstrate and do working examples.\n\n**Q46: Can we change the time of the sessions? My other classes are clashing. I've already told the TA, but haven't received a response.**\n\n**A46:** The Wednesday session cannot be moved. The Thursday session might be possible, but the sessions are generally kept in the evening because many students work during the day. We record all sessions, so you can view them later. We can try to schedule an earlier doubt-clearing session, perhaps on Friday, but I'll have to discuss it with the team. What time on Friday works for you?\n",

    "content": "# Live Session: 29 Jan 2025\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"2025-01-29 Week 3 - Session 2 - TDS Jan 25\" describes metadata for an educational image, not the image itself.  It tells us the following:\n\n* **Date:** The image was likely created or is relevant to January 29th, 2025.\n* **Week/Session:**  It's from the third week of a course or program, specifically session two of that week.\n* **TDS Jan 25:** This likely refers to a specific topic, unit, or assignment related to \"TDS\" (Total Dissolved Solids?  This is a guess; more context is needed to know for sure)  and dated January 25th, 2025.  This suggests the material might be covering something that was introduced or discussed on that earlier date.\n\n**Without seeing the actual image, we cannot describe its content.** The alt text only provides the context and date information about *when* the image was used in a learning environment, not *what* the image depicts.  To describe the image, we'd need to see the image itself.  It could be a diagram, chart, photo, graph, etc., related to whatever \"TDS\" represents in this educational context.]](https://youtu.be/EPiVIP97fzI)\n\n**Q1: I am a student, and I joined the session without using my IITM ID. How do I rejoin with my IITM ID?**\n\n**A1:** You need to rejoin the session using your IITM ID. We don't allow anyone to join without their IITM ID.\n\n**Q2: Today's session is mostly about doubt clearing. I haven't seen the GAs yet. Can I come tomorrow after I've solved them?**\n\n**A2:** Tomorrow and the day after, we will mostly be covering content, so there won't be much scope for doubt clearing. We can address doubts towards the end of the session or while discussing a specific topic if the doubt relates to that topic.\n\n**Q3: Will the sessions cover content relevant to GA2?**\n\n**A3:** No, the content will be relevant to GA3. The deadline for GA3 has been pushed to Wednesday.\n\n**Q4: GA2 content looks straightforward. If I have any doubts after the sessions, I'll ask then.**\n\n**A4:** That would be great.\n\n**Q5: I was confused about the image compression in [unclear]. I tried to copy the code and run it in Colab, but it asked for third-party authentication. I wasn't sure what it was asking, so I pulled back.**\n\n**A5:** I haven't used the code for solving that particular image compression question; I only used the provided website. I tried using the code, but it gave me an error about dimensions not matching the original file's dimensions. That's why I used the web application. There is a specific use case for this. Should we copy all the things like that and then change the parameters? For example, the path will be related to some website URL. It will be used in future classes. We probably won't spend much time on image compression, but it is important from a web perspective. In a particular video, they talked about how 50-51% of information on web pages is in image format, so reducing image size is important. From a project perspective, it won't be that relevant in future weeks.\n\n**Q6: I tried to do Git commits from my CLI, but based on the given ID, a new repository was created. I want to use the one I created for GA1. How can I make sure that whatever changes I'm making get committed to the repository I signed up for?**\n\n**A6:** Please share your screen. (The instructor then appears to have difficulty understanding the question.)\n\n**Q7: I have a doubt in question 4. Actually, I've done the Vercel file for question 6 (What is the Vercel URL?). I'm uploading that URL, but it's not showing that it's up. Can I share my screen?**\n\n**A7:** Yes, please share your screen. (The instructor then guides the student through troubleshooting steps, including checking the code, going to the Vercel dashboard, and appending `/api` to the URL. The issue is that the Flask module is not installed on Vercel. The instructor suggests using a capital 'F' in `Flask` in the requirements.txt file. The instructor also suggests using GitHub, where a requirements.txt file is not needed.)\n\n**Q8: In the FastAPI question, I'm pushing the website, but it's not taking the conditions (API class equals 1A or class equals 1B) mentioned in the question. It's also giving the whole JSON file. What should I do?**\n\n**A8:** Regarding the Vercel question, you can mention a capital 'F' for Flask, but I think it won't install because... I've just checked, and on the GitHub page, I don't have a requirements file. If you push it to GitHub and it's connected to GitHub, you don't need the requirements file. Something else is the issue. It's not able to pull the Flask module. You should not have to install it separately while running the file. I used `http.server`. There's example code given in GA2 itself for question 6. There's sample code there that uses `http.server`. I just modified that bit and put my function in there, and it works without any issues. The only difference is that I modified that and put the function inside that piece of code that handles the request. You don't need a separate `requirements.txt` file; Vercel can run the program without that. You still need to verify that your function actually runs. That's one thing you'll have to check. Regarding the FastAPI question, there's a logic error in your code. It shouldn't fetch all of it. Your query actually says `class` (CLASSS) without an underscore. If you put an underscore there, it will probably give you the correct response.\n\n**Q9: I'm getting an error in question 10 of GA2. (Student shares screen.)**\n\n**A9:** Please close the picture-in-picture; it won't disconnect the session. (The instructor then guides the student through troubleshooting steps, including copying the error and posting it on Discourse and tagging Anand. The instructor suggests using the ngrok URL (the one in front of forwarding in the terminal). The error is a Cloudflare error. The instructor suggests copying the error and sending it on Discourse and tagging Anand.)\n\n**Q10: I wanted to say that while installing ngrok with the terminal, I wasn't able to do that, so I installed it in a different directory using the app. Is it doing anything? When I run it from here...**\n\n**A10:** It shouldn't matter because we are able to access it through the browser. It was still able to access it, and you can see a 200 OK on there. That means the site is running okay; your model is running okay. Why you're getting a Cloudflare error, I'm not entirely sure. That's normally to do with the CDN service that is giving some sort of response out there. We'll have to check with Anand what the issue is.\n\n**Q11: Is my screen visible? In the Vercel question, sometimes it shows correctly, and now it's showing an error. It's showing correctly again. I don't know why this happens. The score also...**\n\n**A11:** There was a slight bug; we discussed it this morning with Anand. There was a slight bug in the random generator for the file that you use. I believe it's been fixed now. That's why you're not getting an error at the moment. If you come across this problem again, notify us on Discourse. It shouldn't give you a problem anymore.\n\n**Q12: One more thing: in the FastAPI question, I'm pushing the website, but it's not taking the conditions (API class equals 1A or class equals 1B) mentioned in the question. It's also giving the whole JSON file. What should I do?**\n\n**A12:** The issue is likely in your code's logic. You should try to fix the code. The word `class` itself is a keyword in Python, so you'll have to find a workaround that enables you to use a query called `class` (CLASSS) without the underscore.\n\n**Q13: One more question: in question 9 (FastAPI), I'm giving the URL, but when I run the file, it shows the whole data. When I add conditions, it also shows the whole data. I'll show you that. Should I run this first?**\n\n**A13:** Before we do that, let's see what error comes out. You haven't put the actual correct URL, right? Just add `/api`. It's because this particular Flask module is not installed on Vercel. You should use the `requests` module instead of the `curl` command. You just use the requests and send the inputs to it. Because the proxy has its own method of doing some of these functions that don't match OpenAI's. It might have been a coincidence that it worked for 3.5. If you use the documentation that Anand has provided, then that might help. If you go back to where you get the token... You'll have to provide the documentation in this form. You'll use the requests instead of using the curl command. You just use the requests and send the inputs to it.\n\n**Q14: In question 5, I've enabled it, but I'm getting an \"unexpected end of JSON input\" error. I'm not sure why. I've tried different structures for the JSON.**\n\n**A14:** Copy this JSON to VS Code and save it as a JSON file. VS Code will parse it so you can see it better. At the bottom, you have an extra required address and additional properties that are not necessary. That shouldn't cause it to be invalid JSON. Try without that. Just remove that extra bit and try without it.\n\n**Q15: One more thing: in FastAPI question 9, I'm giving the URL, but it's giving me the whole data. Even when I add conditions, it shows the whole data. I'll show you. Should I run this first?**\n\n**A15:** Add `/api` at the end of that. That's some logic error in your code. It should not fetch all of it. There's some logic error. You're getting a Cloudflare error. That's something to do with the CDN service giving some sort of response. We'll have to check with Anand.\n\n**Q16: Is my screen visible? In this Vercel question, what happened is that sometimes it was showing correctly earlier, and now it's showing an error. And look, it's showing correctly again. I don't know why this happens. The score also...**\n\n**A16:** At the moment, it's working, right? There was a slight bug; we discussed it this morning with Anand. There was a slight bug in the random generator for the file that you use. I believe it's been fixed now. That's why you're not getting an error at the moment. If you come across this problem again, notify us on Discourse.\n\n**Q17: I'm getting an error from this. I don't know how...**\n\n**A17:** In the ninth question, you're getting an error. Earlier, it was working fine. You'll need to... this is the Vercel one, right? No, this is the FastAPI one. You'll have to run the server for that. You should post this on Discourse. Just copy that whole error message itself and put it in a notepad or something, and then post on Discourse.\n\n**Q18: One more thing I wanted to say: actually, I'm not... while installing ngrok with this terminal, I wasn't able to do that, so I installed it in a different directory using the app. Is it doing anything? When I run it from here...**\n\n**A18:** It shouldn't matter because we are able to access it through the browser. It was still able to access it, and you can see a 200 OK on there. That means the site is running okay; your model is running okay. Why you're getting a Cloudflare error, I'm not entirely sure. That's normally to do with the CDN service that is giving some sort of response out there. We'll have to check with Anand what the issue is.\n\n**Q19: Is my screen visible? In this Vercel question, what happened is that sometimes it was showing correctly, and now it's showing an error. And look, it's showing correctly again. I don't know why this happens. The score also...**\n\n**A19:** It looks like a Cloudflare error. I've noted this error. It is from Cloudflare. You could just try again. When did you try this, apart from just now? You got the same error yesterday as well? Yeah, so that's some logic error in your code. It should not fetch all of it. There is some logic error.\n\n**Q20: Should I install it separately?**\n\n**A20:** No, you won't require requirements for it. Vercel is able to run the program without that.\n\n**Q21: For Vercel, I will take the example code and try to run it. One more question: in question 9 (FastAPI), I'm giving the URL, but when I run the file, it shows the whole data. When I add conditions, it also shows the whole data. I'll show you that.**\n\n**A21:** You should use the requests module and send a request using headers and all those informations. What you are using is actually OpenAI's own library, and that will not work. You will have to use the requests module and send the request just like the examples shown. There will be a URL, a header, and a payload. If you use their own library, it will not construct it correctly. Because the proxy has its own method of doing some of these functions that don't match OpenAI's. For 3.5, it worked, but that was more of a coincidence. If you use the documentation that is there on the AI proxy that Anand has provided, there's documentation there. If you use that documentation, then that might help. If you go back to where you get the token... You'll have to provide the documentation in this form. You'll use the requests instead of using the curl command. You just use the requests and send the inputs to it.\n\n**Q22: This was in ROE last term. I'm getting an error. How?**\n\n**A22:** This was a really fascinating question. There is a way, in fact many ways, to get it to say yes. You just have to trick it into saying yes. Just look up previous Discourse posts; you will probably find suggestions on there as well.\n\n**Q23: Can I get the code for this?**\n\n**A23:** He will... didn't he provide that in a Discourse post? Someone has pasted it on Discourse. If not, we can always ask him to provide it.\n\n**Q24: I've taken one more course, something on business BA or something like that. There is no GA at all for this. There is a GA, but you don't submit here. These two courses are somewhat different.**\n\n**A24:** Right, right.\n\n**Q25: When I joined (late), an ngrok error was being shown by someone. I'm also getting a very similar error. I couldn't follow the discussion at all. I joined towards the end. Shall I share my screen?**\n\n**A25:** Just before you share your screen, was it giving you a Cloudflare error? (The student describes the error.) You can share your screen. I think your problem is slightly different. (The instructor then guides the student through troubleshooting steps, including checking the ngrok URL and restarting the Lama server. The issue is that ngrok is running outside of the Ubuntu environment, and the Lama server is running inside the Ubuntu environment. The instructor suggests installing ngrok in the Windows machine and then creating a tunnel from there. The student tries this, but it's still giving an error. The instructor then suggests using the directly executable file for ngrok.)\n\n**Q26: I tried all this, same issue. I'm getting an error. I think I've tried all this, same issue.**\n\n**A26:** The account is limited to one simultaneous session. You've got another session running somewhere. I think that is inside VS WSL. You'll have to stop that. You'll have to check for that. The output that your code is generating is wrong. It's generating null, null, which is wrong. Just try to check for... can you go back to the question once? It is sending some URL-encoded parameter. There might be a mistake while reading those parameters. Just changing that code will help. There's a problem with my code where it's fetching null for all the data, which it should not. You can either ask on Discourse or try to fix it yourself.\n",

    "content": "# Live Session: 30 Jan 2025\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"2025-01-30 Week 3 - Session 3 - TDS Jan 25\" describes metadata, not the content of an image.  It tells us the image likely belongs to a learning management system or a set of course materials. Let's break down what it means:\n\n* **2025-01-30:** This is a date – January 30th, 2025.  This indicates when the image was created or last updated, or possibly when the lesson containing the image was delivered.\n\n* **Week 3:**  This shows the image is part of the third week of a course or program.\n\n* **Session 3:** This signifies that the image is from the third session within that week.  This suggests a structured learning plan with multiple sessions per week.\n\n* **TDS Jan 25:** This is the least clear part.  \"TDS\" likely refers to an abbreviation for a course, subject, project, or specific learning unit. \"Jan 25\" could be a reference date for the material covered in the session, the date the material was originally created, or another relevant date.  More context is needed to understand this part completely.\n\n**In short:** The alt text provides contextual information about the image's place within a larger learning program.  The image itself is unknown without actually seeing it. To help a student, one would need to see the image to describe its content.  The alt text only tells us *when and where* the image fits into a learning sequence.]](https://youtu.be/6VfrL5b8lLc)\n\n**Q1: My screen is visible?**\n\n**A1:** Yes, your screen is visible.\n\n**Q2: I posted on Discourse and emailed you about a problem deploying a Flask application on Vercel. The Flask module is not getting downloaded. Can you show the vercel.json configuration file?**\n\n**A2:** The error likely stems from your `requirements.txt` file. Did you create a new virtual environment for this project, or did you install Flask on your global environment? When deploying Flask applications on Vercel, you need to keep a few things in mind. I'll show you how to create a `requirements.txt` file without manually typing it.\n\n**Q3: I added a requirements.txt file with Flask and Flask-Cors, but Kartal sir said I could use the example in the question. Should I remove the requirements.txt file and rewrite the code? The code is working, but I'm getting a null output instead of a list of integers as requested.**\n\n**A3:** Let's see your screen. The Flask application might be running fine as intended, but you might not be seeing the output. Sharing your screen would help me understand what's happening. You are getting a null output because you are not using a virtual environment. Let's create one.\n\n**Q4: When writing tools needed in requirements.txt, do we need to specify the version?**\n\n**A4:** Yes, you have to specify the version. But you don't have to manually type the `requirements.txt` file. You can use a single-line command in Python: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. This will create the file with all the libraries and their versions in your virtual environment (or global environment if you don't have a virtual environment).\n\n**Q5: I tried to create a virtual environment, but it showed an error. I'm using Vercel CLI.**\n\n**A5:** Let's try `python -m venv venv` in PowerShell. If you are using a virtual environment, it will only return the libraries specifically present in that environment. Since you are currently using a global environment, it returns every library.\n\n**Q6: Have you tried the optional exercise I gave you for the Flask API (Zodiac sign one)?**\n\n**A6:** No one has tried it yet. The assignment was to ask for a person's month of birth and return their zodiac sign.\n\n**Q7: The main problem is that I'm spending almost 2-3 days on the TDS assignments. The GAs have 10-18 questions on average.**\n\n**A7:** I understand. The GAs are time-consuming. If you get some time and are in the mood, you can work on the optional mini-project. You can have many more types of ideas and execute them using Flask API.\n\n**Q8: Currently, I'm not in the directory that contains the Vercel file (vercel.json).**\n\n**A8:** I'm just demonstrating how to create the `requirements.txt` file.\n\n**Q9: If I'm running a virtual environment with `uv`, will it only copy out the tools that are in the virtual environment?**\n\n**A9:** Exactly. That's a downside of `uv`. When using `uv`, you are not installing those libraries. If they are not installed, they won't be present in your virtual environment, and therefore won't be in your `requirements.txt` file. For minor projects that you don't need to deploy, `uv` is fine. Otherwise, create a virtual environment and install the libraries there.\n\n**Q10: Now it's showing nothing. I don't know why.**\n\n**A10:** Your server is not running. Run `vercel deploy --prod` again. I'm not a big fan of Vercel CLI; I usually push to GitHub and then establish a connection between Vercel and GitHub. Let's open the dev tools (right-click, inspect), go to the console, and reload. Show me your code.\n\n**Q11: I'm using httpx.**\n\n**A11:** Yesterday, I told you that you can use the example file from the question. That's why you rewrote the code. Otherwise, you would have created the `requirements.txt` file and deployed both. This was working yesterday; now it's showing blank. Can you show me the code?\n\n**Q12: It was working perfectly yesterday. Now it's showing blank. An error page is showing. Sir told me to add `/api` to the URL, and it would show some data. When I entered that link in the assignment, it gave me a null list.**\n\n**A12:** That's what happens when nothing is showing. Can you scroll down? You're using CORS. You've used a lot of complexity; you've made it a lot more complex. You took help from ChatGPT. That explains the comments. It's not directing you somewhere. The JSON file is not present in the API folder. Let's go to line 5 of your code. Add `../` before `q` to include the parent directory. Save and redeploy.\n\n**Q13: Should I remove the `.vercel` folder and redeploy?**\n\n**A13:** No, that won't work. Vercel CLI created that folder; it contains build instructions.\n\n**Q14: Are the vercel.json and everything inside the API file?**\n\n**A14:** No, they are in the `vercel-python/api` directory.\n\n**Q15: I don't know how to use `class` as a variable name in question 9.**\n\n**A15:** `class` is a keyword in Python. You can't use it as a variable name. I'll explain how to handle this. You need a different variable name. I used an alias. I'll explain what that means.\n\n**Q16: When passing multiple parameters with the same name, how do I handle it?**\n\n**A16:** You need to use lists. Import `List` from the `typing` library. I got this from ChatGPT. Always learn from ChatGPT, but also learn from the process. The query will take all the strings and put them into one list. The default value is used if no parameter is passed. An alias is another name for a variable. The variable name is `className`, but we can use the `class` parameter using this alias.\n\n**Q17: My code was working correctly except for the name. I don't know how to write it.**\n\n**A17:** You are using `httpx`. You're also using `index.py`. This is not Flask-based; it's more like an HTTP server.\n\n**Q18: I'll try to do it again according to the requirements and add the requirements.txt file. After that, I'll share my screen.**\n\n**A18:** Okay, you can do that. The Flask-based code is not needed here.\n\n**Q19: I'm confused because it was working perfectly (or at least working) yesterday.**\n\n**A19:** Can you open Vercel again? Yesterday, was this particular box showing \"Not Found\"? When you added `/api` to the URL, it showed a dictionary. It was returning a JSON object. Show me your folder structure.\n\n**Q20: I created the directory, then another folder `api`, and then `index.py` inside `api`.**\n\n**A20:** Should I remove the `.vercel` folder and redeploy? No, that won't work. Vercel CLI created that folder; it contains build instructions.\n\n**Q21: Show your folder structure.**\n\n**A21:** I created the directory, then another folder `api`, and then `index.py` inside `api`.\n\n**Q22: If I use `uv`, will it only copy the tools in the virtual environment?**\n\n**A22:** Yes.\n\n**Q23: What is more convenient? Directly integrating GitHub and creating files there, saving space on my local system?**\n\n**A23:** I don't think that will save space on your local system because you have to create files locally before pushing them to Git.\n\n**Q24: Can we use the query function?**\n\n**A24:** Yes, absolutely. It's working like this. I'll comment it out, duplicate it, and comment it out once. Then we can run this. The query function is working. We have got the entire row where the city was. We can extract the population using this. It's working perfectly fine. It returned the population of Delhi.\n\n**Q25: Do we need to mention values [square bracket] zero, values zero, if we are mentioning population only?**\n\n**A25:** That's a very good question. If you use this, it will return a series (a Pandas term). It's just a column; it won't give you the exact value. We have to extract the zeroth value. We have to extract the values. `values` will return this.\n\n**Q26: Question 9: I don't know how to use `class` as a variable name.**\n\n**A26:** `class` is a keyword. You can't use it as a variable name. Create a different variable name. I used an alias.\n\n**Q27: Question 6: Can you take the last of the class now, or should I wait?**\n\n**A27:** Let's arrange a separate meeting to discuss this. I'll also look into your file. You can share it on Discourse or email it to me.\n\n**Q28: Can we use `httpie` instead of `requests`?**\n\n**A28:** Yes, you can change it to `httpx`. `httpie` is a command-line tool, not a Python module. I'm not sure about `httpie`.\n\n**Q29: Can we get the names of the words and their embeddings separately in the JSON?**\n\n**A29:** No, it won't get you the name of the embedding. It will store embeddings for each word. You can pass three different values. You can calculate three embeddings. Then you can compute the cosine similarity between them. The first index would get the embedding for bicycle, the second for cycle, and the third for `biycle`.\n\n**Q30: Can we get a 3x1,1056 dimensional array?**\n\n**A30:** You won't get it directly, but you can store it in whatever format you want. You can store it in an array. I don't know how to convert JSON to an array.\n\n**Q31: One more thing about embeddings. Can we go back to the writer pad?**\n\n**A31:** Sure. Let's say I'm using a certain model for creating embeddings. Let's say that model contains a billion words. It will check the similarity of a word (like \"kitten\") with all those billion words. It will check the rate of similarity between this particular word and that word. These models vary in the number of words they carry. A small model has about a billion; a medium-sized model has around 50 billion; a large model has several more. These numbers might be a bit wrong, but that's the distinction. The larger the model, the better the embeddings. Here, we have 1,056. That means it's checking the similarity of a word with 1,056 words in its database. That's how embeddings work. For creating embeddings, there's a library in NLP, actually ML, with a module called `word2vec`. It's deployed on Hugging Face.\n\n**Q32: Is Hugging Face part of the TDS course?**\n\n**A32:** I think it's been removed. It would be too heavy for TDS.\n\n**Q33: Can we create LLM applications on Google Colab?**\n\n**A33:** Not exactly, but we can make API calls and get embeddings for words. For example, let's say we have the word \"Anand\".\n\n**Q34: Sorry for interrupting, but is Hugging Face part of the TDS course?**\n\n**A34:** I think it's been removed, probably because it's too heavy for the course.\n\n**Q35: My next question is why are these vectors (embeddings) so long? It's just a word. For a paragraph, it must be thousands of variables.**\n\n**A35:** It won't be. We're getting embeddings from OpenAI. We'll always get embeddings of the same length. It uses 1,536 numbers to represent a word. These are different features of the word. It might involve the shape of a bicycle. Does it involve SVD? It must be doing SVD.\n\n**Q36: Can we use wrongly spelled words and get embeddings for them?**\n\n**A36:** You can try. It should work. Anything similar to \"bicycle\" should work.\n\n**Q37: My last question is how can we pass multiple words at the same time and get their embeddings separately?**\n\n**A37:** I think this is the way you can pass multiple words. This should get us two different vectors. It's a list. The first embedding is for bicycle, and the second is for cycle.\n\n**Q38: Can we get the names of the words and their embeddings separately in the JSON?**\n\n**A38:** No, it won't get you the name of the embedding. It will store embeddings for each word. You can pass three different values. You can calculate three embeddings. Then you can compute the cosine similarity between them. The first index would get the embedding for bicycle, the second for cycle, and the third for `biycle`.\n\n**Q39: Can we have a session on Hugging Face?**\n\n**A39:** We can have a session during the last week of the course. The last week should be a bit lighter. Hugging Face is totally open source, so it would be very helpful during the NLP part of the course. But Hugging Face won't be of much context when it comes to TDS. It would be for learning only.\n\n**Q40: My first doubt is, can we use `httpie` instead of `requests`?**\n\n**A40:** Yes, you can change it to `httpx`. I'm not sure about `httpie`. It's a command-line tool. I've never used it. I think even if it does, it shouldn't matter much because it's just a different library that allows you to make requests. I wanted to shift to another question. I don't know how to use this particular thing. Maybe it's possible to use it in Python, but I don't know. `requests` is better. If it's complicated, it's not a good tool. At the end, it's also using the `requests` module.\n\n**Q41: My next question is why are the vectors (embeddings) so long?**\n\n**A41:** That's the dimension it uses to represent a word. A higher dimension means better representation, but it requires more storage. You can think of them as a vector space, like a 3D space. Instead of representing a word in 3D, we're representing it in 1,536 dimensions. These are different features of the word. One might represent shape.\n\n**Q42: Does it involve SVD?**\n\n**A42:** I don't know the exact algorithm OpenAI uses to calculate embeddings. You can search on Google or ask ChatGPT. You can also ask ChatGPT for code completion.\n\n**Q43: Question 9: Three different documents. For example, these are three different documents. You can think of them as paragraphs or words. The purpose is to figure out which word is related to the query word. One could be cat, one could be dog, and the other could be elephant. The query word could be kitten. You have to figure out which word relates more to it. The way to do it is using embeddings.**\n\n**A43:** You would have to figure out the embedding for each one of them. The way to compare two words is to compute the dot product. Cosine similarity is the dot product divided by the norm of each vector. OpenAI returns normalized vectors. The cosine similarity between \"bicycle\" and \"cycle\" would be higher than between \"bicycle\" and \"apple\". That's how computers store this information.\n",

The alt text provides information about the image's context, but gives no visual description.  To assist students, we need the actual *visual content* of the image.\n\nThis alt text tells us the following:\n\n* **Date:** The image was likely created or used on January 31st, 2025.\n* **Week/Session:** It belongs to Week 3, Session 4 of a course or program.\n* **TDS Jan 25:** This likely refers to a specific topic, subject, or event called \"TDS\" that occurred or was discussed on January 25th (presumably in the same course/program).  \"TDS\" could be an abbreviation that needs further context to be understood (e.g., Total Dissolved Solids in a science context, or a completely different meaning).\n\n\n**To properly describe the image for student assistance, please provide the visual details of the image itself.**  For example, is it:\n\n* **A graph?**  (What kind?  What are the axes showing? What are the key data points?)\n* **A diagram?** (What does it depict? What are the labeled parts?)\n* **A photograph?** (What is shown in the photograph?  What is its relevance to the metadata?)\n* **A chart?** (What kind of chart? What information is it conveying?)\n* **Text-based?** (What is the text saying? What is its importance?)\n\n\nOnce you provide the visual description, I can give a much more helpful and detailed explanation for students.]](https://youtu.be/sdg4N-H4BR0)\n\n**Q1: In today's session, what will be covered?**\n\n**A1:** We will be discussing the function calling part of OpenAI. We will create a program that takes user prompts in English, identifies which function to call based on the prompt, and then calls that function.\n\n**Q2: What is the first step in the process?**\n\n**A2:** First, we import the `requests` library. Then, we'll get the headers and URL for the request, and finally, we'll create a JSON body for the request.\n\n**Q3: What is the goal of the program?**\n\n**A3:** The program aims to automate the process of ordering something from an online store. It will take a user's order in plain English, understand the request, and place the order. It will also include a feature for updating existing orders.\n\n**Q4: How will the program understand the user's prompt?**\n\n**A4:** The program will send the user's prompt to OpenAI. OpenAI will use its function calling capabilities to identify the appropriate function to call from a predefined set of functions within your application, and return the function name and parameters in a JSON format.\n\n**Q5: What are the predefined functions?**\n\n**A5:** The predefined functions are a set of tools your application provides. Examples include `get_weather_info` (which takes a location as a parameter) and `best_hotels` (which also takes a location). OpenAI will determine which function to call based on the user's prompt.\n\n**Q6: How does OpenAI determine which function to call?**\n\n**A6:** OpenAI analyzes the user's prompt and, based on its understanding of the context and semantics, selects the appropriate function from the predefined set. The response from OpenAI will include the function name and its required parameters in JSON format.\n\n**Q7: How does the program use the OpenAI response?**\n\n**A7:** Your application receives the JSON response from OpenAI, extracts the function name and parameters, and then executes the function with those parameters. The result is then sent back to the user. OpenAI acts as a proxy for a human agent, handling natural language input and translating it into structured data for your application.\n\n**Q8: Is the `order` function dependent on the above-written cell?**\n\n**A8:** Yes, the `order` function uses variables defined in previous cells.\n\n**Q9: How is the JSON response handled?**\n\n**A9:** The JSON response from OpenAI is structured data that your application can easily process. It contains the function name and the parameters needed to execute that function.\n\n**Q10: How can we handle cases where the user doesn't provide complete information?**\n\n**A10:** You can instruct OpenAI to request missing information. The handling of incomplete requests depends on your application's design. OpenAI itself might request the missing data.\n\n**Q11: How can we integrate a voice model?**\n\n**A11:** You can integrate a speech-to-text model (like Whisper from OpenAI) to convert voice commands into text prompts for your application.\n\n**Q12: How do we package the Colab notebook into a full-fledged application?**\n\n**A12:** We'll demonstrate this in a future session by creating another function and packaging the entire application into a Docker image.\n\n**Q13: What is the role of prompt engineering in this process?**\n\n**A13:** Prompt engineering is less about a specific science and more about understanding how the system works to write effective prompts that yield the desired results. The course will cover this in more detail.\n\n**Q14: What if the `order` function doesn't work as expected?**\n\n**A14:** The instructor suggests checking the code, ensuring the correct parameters are passed, and handling potential errors gracefully. The instructor also suggests using `json.loads` to convert strings to JSON objects.\n\n**Q15: What is the duration of the Review of Exercises (ROE)?**\n\n**A15:** The ROE duration varies from term to term, ranging from 45 minutes to 1.5 hours. It's recommended to save your work frequently.\n\n**Q16: What if the user's prompt is missing information?**\n\n**A16:** The instructor suggests adding a system prompt to OpenAI to explicitly request missing parameters.\n\n**Q17: How do we handle the `UUID` generation to ensure uniqueness?**\n\n**A17:** The `UUID` library generally provides unique identifiers. If you need to reduce the chance of collisions, you can increase the size of the UUID. More information is available in the UUID documentation.\n\n**Q18: How do we handle the file path in a deployed application?**\n\n**A18:** Instead of using absolute paths (`os.path`), use relative paths to ensure the application works correctly in different environments. For deployed applications, you would typically use a `.env` file to store sensitive information like API keys.\n\n**Q19: What is the overall approach to building this application?**\n\n**A19:** The approach is to use OpenAI's function calling capabilities to translate natural language prompts into structured data that your application can process. This allows for a more natural user experience without the need for a complex UI. The instructor emphasizes the importance of understanding how to parse JSON responses and handle errors.\n",

It tells us the following:\n\n* **Date:** The image was likely created or is relevant to February 1st, 2025.\n* **Week/Session:** This suggests it's part of a course or program, specifically week 3, session 5.  This implies a structured learning environment.\n* **TDS Jan 25:** This is the most ambiguous part.  \"TDS\" likely refers to an abbreviation relevant to the course content.  It could stand for something like \"Topic Discussion Session,\" \"Technical Data Sheet,\" \"Total Dissolved Solids\" (if the course is science-related), or something else entirely. \"Jan 25\" likely refers to a date, possibly when the topic or data was introduced or relevant.\n\n\n**Without seeing the image, we can't describe its content.**  The alt text only provides context about *when* and *where* in a learning plan the image belongs.

Notebooks are great for sharing with others who may not understand the code, as you can add Markdown to explain each step.\n\n**Q2: In the delete order function, could a wrong order ID get deleted if the prompt contains multiple things that could match multiple orders?**\n\n**A2:** That's a good question. This application isn't built to be very robust. The goal is to demonstrate GPT's ability to convert natural language into functions that the application understands. A real-world application would have a more robust interface (website or local app) with precisely crafted inputs to map to functions, preventing such errors.\n\n**Q3: How can I avoid manually managing virtual environments and dependencies when deploying my application?**\n\n**A3:** Use `uv`. `uv` is similar to Docker in that it handles dependencies without requiring manual management of virtual environments. You just specify your dependencies at the top of your code, and `uv` handles everything else, including creating and disposing of the virtual environment. This is especially useful when dealing with many submissions with different package requirements, as seen in a previous project with nearly 700 submissions.\n\n**Q4: How does the application know which function to run based on the user's request?**\n\n**A4:** You send the user's natural language request (prompt) and a list of your application's capabilities to GPT. GPT determines which function to run and the required parameters, returning this information as structured JSON. Your application then uses this JSON to execute the appropriate function.\n\n**Q5: What is the purpose of `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`?**\n\n**A5:** This is the entry point for your application. The Python interpreter runs from top to bottom, but it won't run the code within this block unless the file is the starting file of the application. This is crucial for multi-file applications where the interpreter needs to know where to begin.\n\n**Q6: Should I create a tunnel for this application?**\n\n**A6:** No, there's no need to create a tunnel if you want others to try it. Using a tool like ngrok allows others to access your server directly and send queries. However, be aware that this might crash your system if the queries aren't clean, as there's no robust error handling.\n\n**Q7: How do I pass URL-encoded parameters to a FastAPI application?**\n\n**A7:** You pass them in the URL itself. For example, `localhost:8000/order?q=Laptop,2,123 Main St,2024-02-29`. The application then reads the parameter from the URL.\n\n**Q8: Why is my application returning a null response or a 422 error?**\n\n**A8:** Several things could cause this. Ensure that:\n\n- The `prices` dictionary is defined globally, not within a function.\n- The prompt is correctly formatted and includes all necessary information (items, address, time).\n- The application can communicate with the outside world (check network connectivity).\n- You are using the correct key in the JSON response (`.keys()`).\n\n**Q9: How do I use Docker?**\n\n**A9:** Docker creates lightweight, self-contained images that run inside a Docker engine. This isolates your application from the underlying system, making it portable and easy to deploy anywhere. You build the image using `podman build -t tds-hello .` (the `.` refers to the current working directory). Then, you run it using `podman run -it tds-hello bash`. The `bash` command opens an interactive shell within the Docker container.\n\n**Q10: What are the use cases for Docker?**\n\n**A10:** Docker is useful for deploying applications to various environments without worrying about dependencies or system specifics. You create a Docker image containing your application and its dependencies. Anyone can then download and run the image regardless of their operating system. This is especially helpful for teams with different setups or when deploying to multiple clients.\n\n**Q11: What should I focus on for the GA3 project?**\n\n**A11:** The GA3 project will involve using the concepts covered today, but on a larger scale. You'll need to create more robust error handling and focus on prompt engineering to ensure the LLM generates the correct code. A previous session covered the basics of LLM calls, tokenization, embeddings, and image URI encoding. Review that session and the material on prompt engineering to prepare. The goal is to create a self-writing program that uses the LLM to generate and correct code dynamically.\n",

To send a POST request, you need an extension like Thunder Client or Postman. Thunder Client doesn't require a login, but Postman does. However, Thunder Client is now a paid service.\n\n**Q2: Previously, I was seeing some things, but now I'm getting the \"method not allowed\" error. I don't know why.**\n\n**A2:** Let's troubleshoot this. We'll use Thunder Client.\n\n**Q3: After changing my method to POST, what do I do next?**\n\n**A3:** Go to the \"Body\" section in Thunder Client. Create a JSON object using curly braces `{}`. Then, refer to question 7 for the JSON object to copy and paste. Remove the three dots (...) from the copied JSON. Click the \"Send\" button.\n\n**Q4: I'm getting an error: \"API key client option must be set either by passing API key to the client or by setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.\" Am I trying to access an OpenAI key?**\n\n**A4:** Yes, you are. Since you don't have a `.env` file, you need to create one. For now, comment out the code after line 172 and replace it with `return \"hello\"` to test. Restart the server.\n\n**Q5: Thunder Client is not showing any paywall.**\n\n**A5:** Thunder Client has a free version with limitations (e.g., 15 collections and 15 requests).\n\n**Q6: Earlier, Thunder Client was free. When did it change?**\n\n**A6:** Recently.\n\n**Q7: I'm still stuck. Can you spell \"Thunder Client\"?**\n\n**A7:** T-H-U-N-D-E-R-C-L-I-E-N-T\n\n**Q8: I'm still getting errors. What's wrong?**\n\n**A8:** Let's review your code. You're trying to send a request using the OpenAI module, which won't work. You need to send the request through an API proxy.\n\n**Q9: I tried using an API proxy, but I still got errors.**\n\n**A9:** Let's focus on getting the basic functionality working. We'll create a simple application and send a POST request using Thunder Client.\n\n**Q10: In the code, what goes in the brackets on lines 19, 20, 21, and 23?**\n\n**A10:** Those lines are for allowing requests from external servers. You can list the servers you want to allow. If you use `*`, anyone can access the application. It's better to restrict access by listing specific servers. For example, if you only want to allow access from `server1` and `server2`, you would list them. You only need to mention the domain name.\n\n**Q11: I'm stuck on the Docker part of the assignment.**\n\n**A11:** Let's review the Docker process. You need to create a Docker image and push it. The deliverables are the Git repo and the Docker image. It should be a public repository.\n\n**Q12: I'm having trouble with the FastAPI part of the assignment. I'm trying to send a POST request to a specific endpoint, but it's not working.**\n\n**A12:** Let's review the code. You'll need to automate the process using an LLM. The LLM will generate the code, which you'll then execute using the subprocess module in Python.\n\n**Q13: Why do we need to use the subprocess module?**\n\n**A13:** In this project, you'll receive tasks in different languages (English, Hindi, Urdu). The LLM will generate the code to handle these tasks. The subprocess module allows you to execute the generated code on your local machine.\n\n**Q14: I have a question about the Base64 encoding in GA3, question 6. I converted an image to Base64 using Python, but the UI said it was wrong. I found another method, but how do I know which Base64 encoding is correct?**\n\n**A14:** If you paste the Base64 encoding into a decoder, you can visually compare the resulting image to the original. The size and resolution should be the same.\n\n**Q15: Some of my answers from previous assignments disappeared after logging out of the website. Why?**\n\n**A15:** That's a known issue. Some answers persist, but others are lost.\n\n**Q16: Can I still check the answers to previous assignments, even though the deadline has passed?**\n\n**A16:** Officially, no. However, if you can check the answers, you can learn from your mistakes.\n\n**Q17: I got stuck on the Docker part of the assignment. Can you elaborate?**\n\n**A17:** It sounds like you may have had issues with Docker push and tagging. Let's review your process.\n\n**Q18: I only gave myself 5 hours for this assignment, which wasn't enough. GA2 took a lot of time, especially the last question (running a local server on a different API).**\n\n**A18:** Five hours is often insufficient for these assignments. GA2, in particular, can be time-consuming.\n\n**Q19: For question 9, I'm trying to write a string that will make the AI say \"yes,\" but it's not working. Can you give me some hints?**\n\n**A19:** That's something you'll have to figure out on your own. Try different prompts. You can also look at previous Discourse posts for ideas.\n\n**Q20: Can I do this using the command prompt, or is there a way to do it from the website?**\n\n**A20:** You can use the website, but you may need to use the command prompt for some tasks.\n\n**Q21: I used Docker Desktop, but I don't remember exactly what I did.**\n\n**A21:** That's okay. Let's focus on the current assignment.\n\n**Q22: What will be the description for the FastAPI part of the assignment?**\n\n**A22:** The description will include the three lines of code you've already seen. These will be part of the request parameters.\n\n**Q23: Why can't I just pass an ID instead of the whole string?**\n\n**A23:** There might be other tasks that require different inputs.\n\n**Q24: How are we restricting access to data from other servers?**\n\n**A24:** We use the `Allow-Origin` header to specify which servers are allowed to access the data. The header contains information about where the request is coming from and the type of request (GET, POST, etc.). If you use `*`, any server can access it. Restricting access is a security measure.\n\n**Q25: What is the trigger point for this assignment?**\n\n**A25:** The trigger point is the same as before: a REST API POST call.\n\n**Q26: For the fetch data from API and save it task, what is the URL?**\n\n**A26:** It can be any URL. The assignment is about comparing your code, not fetching data from a specific URL.\n\n**Q27: What is the purpose of the subprocess module?**\n\n**A27:** The subprocess module allows you to execute commands from within your Python script. This is useful for executing code generated by the LLM.\n\n**Q28: For task 3, what is the expected output?**\n\n**A28:** The task can be described in different ways (e.g., English, Hindi). The LLM will generate the code to handle the task. You'll need to execute that code using the subprocess module.\n\n**Q29: Is there a time frame for completing the project?**\n\n**A29:** We'll prioritize project 1. We'll discuss the timeline for project 4 later.\n\n**Q30: I have a question about the Base64 encoding in GA3, question 6. I converted an image to Base64 using Python, but the UI said it was wrong. I found another method, but how do I know which Base64 encoding is correct?**\n\n**A30:** You can compare the decoded image from both methods visually. The size and resolution should be the same. If the encoding is correct, the decoded image will match the original. You can also encode the image using an encoder to verify.\n\n**Q31: In previous assignments, some answers disappeared after logging out. Can we still check the answers to previous assignments, even though the deadline has passed?**\n\n**A31:** Officially, no. However, reviewing your answers can still be beneficial for learning.\n\n**Q32: Can you give me some hints on how to write a prompt to make the AI in question 9 say \"yes\"?**\n\n**A32:** That's something you'll need to figure out on your own. Try different prompts. You can also look at previous Discourse posts for ideas.\n",

This GA is much easier and lighter than previous ones.\n\n**Q2: How do I extract a table from HTML using Google Sheets?**\n\n**A2:** This functionality is available in Google Sheets but not in Excel (unless you use plugins). The `IMPORTHTML` function will give you a #NAME? error in Excel.\n\n**Q3: How can I extract data from the ODI Batsman Stats webpage?**\n\n**A3:** I'll show you how to extract data from a different webpage, but you can find a similar example in my previous live session on YouTube.\n\n**Q4: What do the parameters in the `IMPORTHTML` function mean?**\n\n**A4:** The four parameters are: URL, query (either \"list\" or \"table\"), index (table number), and locale. The index is zero-based (like Python).\n\n**Q5: How does the `IMPORTHTML` function automatically find the table?**\n\n**A5:** It finds the table based on the index you provide. If there are multiple tables, you'll need to adjust the index accordingly.\n\n**Q6: How can I extract data from a webpage that doesn't use a JSON object?**\n\n**A6:** There are three ways:\n\n- **Method 1:** If the webpage uses a JSON object, you can extract it directly.\n- **Method 2:** Use query selectors in the browser's console to extract the data. This involves finding a common element (class) in the HTML and using JavaScript to extract the data. The `$$` operator establishes a connection between the console and the elements tab. The `.` prefix selects elements by class, and `#` selects by ID.\n- **Method 3:** Sometimes, the data is embedded in JavaScript code within the webpage itself. You can find this in the browser's \"Sources\" tab. You can then use this JavaScript object to extract the data.\n\n**Q7: What's the difference between `innerText` and `innerHTML`?**\n\n**A7:** `innerText` returns only the text content of an element, while `innerHTML` returns the entire HTML code within that element.\n\n**Q8: I'm having trouble using the FastAPI in Chrome. I've posted on Discourse multiple times, but it's still not working. The error is \"Method Not Allowed\".**\n\n**A8:** When using POST requests with FastAPI, you need to specify the method in the request. I'll look into your Discourse post and get back to you. We can also schedule a separate meeting to discuss this further. The issue might be related to how your system interacts with the host (it might be localhost).\n\n**Q9: Regarding the project, the scope seems too broad. Can we narrow it down? Also, what tools are required? Is there a sandbox environment for testing?**\n\n**A9:** The scope is indeed broad. The project's requirements are defined by Anand, who is also the CEO of a company. He's busy, but you can contact him through Discourse. We can discuss the scope and tools further in a meeting. There is no sandbox environment for testing. The goal is to extract data, but the method is not specified. You can enhance the goal by using other tools (Autodesk, Blender, etc.), but the scope should be restricted by the QA team. We can discuss this further in a meeting.\n",

It provides contextual information, indicating:\n\n* **Date:** February 7th, 2025. This suggests the image was created or used on that date.\n* **Week & Session:** This was the fourth week of a course or program, and the fourth session within that week. This helps to place the image within a larger learning sequence.\n* **TDS Jan 25:** This likely refers to a specific topic, module, or project denoted as \"TDS\" (possibly an abbreviation for a subject like \"Technical Data Sheet,\" \"Total Dissolved Solids,\" or something similar), and that it began or was relevant on January 25th.  The exact meaning depends on the course material.\n\n**Without seeing the actual image, it's impossible to describe its content.**  The alt text only gives us the date and the position of the image within a larger learning framework.  To describe the image itself, we'd need to know what it depicts (e.g., a graph, a diagram, a photograph, a flowchart, etc.).]](https://youtu.be/SiW-rcMk0Nk)\n\n**Q1: How difficult are the TDS assignments?**\n\n**A1:** The first assignment was easy, the second was hard, the third was average, and the fourth seems easy. However, the instructor notes that the first assignment was only easy for those with a technical background; for most students, it was very difficult. The difficulty level of subsequent assignments will decrease.\n\n**Q2: Where can I find the recording of yesterday's session?**\n\n**A2:** It's already uploaded to your calendar associated with your IIT-DS ID. It takes Google about an hour or two to process the video.\n\n**Q3: How do I use the BBC Weather API to get weather data for a specific location?**\n\n**A3:** First, use the BBC location service API to get the location ID for your city (e.g., Delhi). You can use the Thunder Client extension or Postman to send the API request. The instructor demonstrates using Postman. Once you have the location ID, use it in the BBC Weather API endpoint.\n\n**Q4: How do I access data from a JSON object in Python?**\n\n**A4:** JSON objects are like Python dictionaries. You can access the data using standard Python dictionary access methods. The instructor shows how to access the \"reports\" key.\n\n**Q5: How do I prepare for the upcoming R.O.E.?**\n\n**A5:** The instructor recommends creating your own code and keeping it ready. Separate sessions will be held to cover this.\n\n**Q6: How do I use Nominatim to get geolocation data?**\n\n**A6:** Nominatim is an API used for extracting geolocation data. The instructor demonstrates how to use it with Postman, showing how to pass parameters for the location (e.g., \"Delhi\") and specify the desired format (JSON). The instructor notes that Nominatim may return multiple results if there are multiple locations with the same name (e.g., Delhi in India and Delhi in the United States).\n\n**Q7: How do I use Beautiful Soup to parse XML data?**\n\n**A7:** The instructor demonstrates using Beautiful Soup to parse XML data from the Hacker News API. The instructor explains how to use the `find_all` function to locate specific tags (e.g., \"item\") and extract the desired information. The instructor also explains the difference between `find` and `findall` functions. The instructor notes that if you encounter issues, you can use an XML viewer to examine the structure of the XML file. The instructor also explains that you should use an XML parser (lxml) instead of an HTML parser.\n\n**Q8: How do I handle situations where the number of values in different lists doesn't match?**\n\n**A8:** If the lengths of lists (e.g., product names, prices, links) don't match, it usually means there's an extra value. The instructor shows how to handle this by checking the lengths of the lists and potentially removing extra values.\n\n**Q9: How do I save the extracted data to a CSV file?**\n\n**A9:** The instructor demonstrates using the pandas library to create a DataFrame from the extracted data and then saving it to a CSV file using the `to_csv` method.\n\n**Q10: How do I scrape data from multiple pages of a website?**\n\n**A10:** Many websites allow scraping, but you should always check their terms and conditions. If a website allows scraping, you can often use a page parameter in the URL to access subsequent pages (e.g., `page=2` for the second page). You can use a for loop to iterate through multiple pages.\n\n**Q11: What are the legal and technical considerations when scraping websites?**\n\n**A11:** Always check the website's terms and conditions before scraping. Some websites can detect when requests are not coming from a browser and may block you. To avoid this, use a sleep timer between requests to give the server time to respond. Selenium is an alternative approach that simulates a browser, but it's more involved than Beautiful Soup. The instructor mentions being banned from Nominatim for sending too many requests in a short time frame.\n\n**Q12: How can I use Beautiful Soup to extract data from an e-commerce website?**\n\n**A12:** The instructor demonstrates using Beautiful Soup to extract product names, prices, and links from an Amazon search result page. The instructor explains how to use the `find_all` function to locate specific tags and attributes (e.g., `span` elements with a specific class) and extract the text content. The instructor also shows how to convert string prices to numerical values. The instructor notes that the order of elements is preserved when using Beautiful Soup, ensuring that data is correctly associated.\n",

To assist students, we need to speculate on what the image itself might contain, based on the alt text.  It's probably a promotional image or a schedule.  Here are some possibilities:\n\n* **A Calendar or Schedule:**  The image might show a calendar page highlighting specific dates in January 2025, each date potentially linked to a different TDS live session.  There might be titles or brief descriptions next to the dates indicating the session topics.  The image may use colors or visual cues to distinguish between different types of sessions or instructors.\n\n* **A Promotional Poster:** It could be a graphic design promoting the TDS live sessions. This poster might include:\n    * **The TDS logo:**  A visual representation of the organization or program offering the sessions.\n    * **Session titles/topics:**  Keywords or short descriptions of the subjects covered (e.g., \"Introduction to Data Analysis,\" \"Advanced Python for Data Science\").\n    * **Dates and times:** Specific dates and times for each session.\n    * **Instructor names (potentially):**  If the instructors are well-known, their names might be included to attract students.\n    * **Registration information:** Possibly a website or contact information for students interested in signing up.\n    * **Visual elements:** Background images, graphics, or relevant icons related to data science or the session's topics.\n\n* **A Screenshot of a Website:** The image could be a screenshot of a webpage displaying a schedule or details about the January 2025 TDS live sessions.  This would include similar information as the promotional poster but within the context of a website layout.\n\n\nIn short, students should expect to see information regarding the timing and topics of live sessions in January 2025, likely related to something called \"TDS\". The specific presentation of this information would vary depending on the image's purpose (promotional, scheduling, etc.).

    "content": "## Local LLMs: Llamafile\n\nYou would have heard of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude, and Llama. Some of these models are available for free, but most of them are not.\n\nAn easy way to run LLMs locally is Mozilla's [Llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile). It's a single executable file that works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. No installation or configuration needed - just download and run.\n\nWatch this Llamafile Tutorial (6 min):\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"Llamafile: Local LLMs Made Easy\" suggests an image related to Llamafile, a tool or platform simplifying the use of Local Large Language Models (LLMs).  The image likely aims to visually communicate this ease of use and the core functionality.  Without seeing the image itself, here are some possibilities of what it might depict:\n\n**Possible Image Contents & Interpretations for Students:**\n\n* **A Simple, User-Friendly Interface:** The image could show a screenshot of the Llamafile interface, highlighting its clean design and intuitive features. This might include elements like a text input box, a clear output area, and perhaps buttons for simple tasks like generating text or translating languages.  The overall message would be that the software is accessible, even for those with limited technical experience.\n\n* **A Workflow Diagram:** The image could be a flowchart or diagram showing a simplified workflow for using Llamafile.  This might illustrate the steps involved in setting up a local LLM, feeding it data, and getting results.  Such a diagram would emphasize the streamlined process and ease of use compared to more complex alternatives.\n\n* **A Comparison Graphic:**  The image might visually compare Llamafile to other methods of using LLMs.  For example, it might show a complex, cluttered interface representing traditional LLM usage juxtaposed with the clean, simple Llamafile interface. This would highlight the advantages of Llamafile in terms of user experience.\n\n* **A Person Using Llamafile:** The image could show a person happily interacting with Llamafile, perhaps looking pleased with the results.  This human element would further emphasize the accessibility and ease of use of the platform. The person might be a student, reinforcing that the tool is suitable for educational purposes.\n\n* **Key Features Highlighted:** The image might focus on specific features of Llamafile.  For example, it might highlight its support for different LLM models, its ability to run locally (emphasizing privacy and offline access), or its integration with other tools.\n\nIn short, the image likely aims to visually communicate that Llamafile makes working with powerful local LLMs significantly easier than traditional methods.  The focus would be on simplicity, accessibility, and user-friendliness.  Students should look for visual cues reinforcing these aspects.]](https://youtu.be/d1Fnfvat6nM)\n\nHere's how to get started\n\n1.

    "content": "## LLM Agents: Building AI Systems That Can Think and Act\n\nLLM Agents are AI systems that can define and execute their own workflows to accomplish tasks. Unlike simple prompt-response patterns, agents make multiple LLM calls, use tools, and adapt their approach based on intermediate results. They represent a significant step toward more autonomous AI systems.\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"Building LLM Agents with LangChain (13 min)\" describes an educational image likely depicting a visual representation of the process or concept of building Large Language Model (LLM) agents using the LangChain framework.  The image probably aims to quickly convey the topic and estimated time commitment for learning it.\n\nTo assist students, here's a breakdown of what the image might contain, based on the alt text:\n\n* **\"Building LLM Agents\"**: The core concept will be about creating autonomous programs (agents) that utilize LLMs.  These agents might perform tasks like web searching, data retrieval, or complex reasoning by leveraging the capabilities of a language model. The image could show a flowchart, diagram, or simplified illustration of this process, potentially including elements like:\n    * **An LLM (e.g., a brain or a box labeled \"LLM\"):** Representing the core language model providing the intelligence.\n    * **An Agent (e.g., a robot or a person):**  Illustrating the autonomous entity interacting with the LLM and the environment.\n    * **Tasks or Goals (e.g., bubbles or arrows):** Showing the objectives the agent is trying to achieve.\n    * **Data sources (e.g., databases or internet icons):** Representing external information the agent might access.\n    * **Actions/Outputs (e.g., speech bubbles or text boxes):** Showing the results or actions performed by the agent.\n\n* **\"with LangChain\"**:  This specifies that the image relates to the LangChain library.  This library is a popular tool for building LLM applications, simplifying the process.  The image might subtly include a LangChain logo or branding, or perhaps visually represent one of LangChain's key components like chains, agents, or memory.\n\n* **\"(13 min)\"**: This indicates that the accompanying video or lesson is approximately 13 minutes long, suggesting a concise and focused introduction to the topic.  This time constraint implies that the image is likely a thumbnail or preview focusing on the key concepts rather than intricate details.\n\n\nIn short, a student seeing this alt text should expect a visual that provides a high-level overview of building LLM agents using LangChain, suitable for a quick understanding of the process and its components within a relatively short timeframe.]](https://youtu.be/DWUdGhRrv2c)\n\n### What Makes an Agent?\n\nAn LLM agent consists of three core components:\n\n1. **LLM Brain**: Makes decisions about what to do next\n2. **Tools**: External capabilities the agent can use (e.g., web search, code execution)\n3. **Memory**: Retains context across multiple steps\n\nAgents operate through a loop:\n\n- Observe the environment\n- Think about what to do\n- Take action using tools\n- Observe results\n- Repeat until task completion\n\n### Command-Line Agent Example\n\nWe've created a minimal command-line agent called [`llm-cmd-agent.py`](llm-cmd-agent.py \":ignore\") that:\n\n1. Takes a task description from the command line\n2. Generates code to accomplish the task\n3. Automatically extracts and executes the code\n4. Passes the results back to the LLM\n5. Provides a final answer or tries again if the execution fails\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n```bash\nuv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"list all Python files under the current directory, recursively, by size\"\nuv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"convert the largest Markdown file to HTML\"\n```\n\nThe agent will:\n\n1. Generate a shell script to list files with their sizes\n2. Execute the script in a subprocess\n3. Capture the output (stdout and stderr)\n4. Pass the output back to the LLM for interpretation\n5. Present a final answer to the user\n\nUnder the hood, the agent follows this workflow:\n\n1. Initial prompt to generate a shell script\n2. Code extraction from the LLM response\n3. Code execution in a subprocess\n4. Result interpretation by the LLM\n5. Error handling and retry logic if needed\n\nThis demonstrates the core agent loop of:\n\n- Planning (generating code)\n- Execution (running the code)\n- Reflection (interpreting results)\n- Adaptation (fixing errors if needed)\n\n### Agent Architectures\n\nDifferent agent architectures exist for different use cases:\n\n1. **ReAct** (Reasoning + Acting): Interleaves reasoning steps with actions\n2. **Reflexion**: Adds self-reflection to improve reasoning\n3. **MRKL** (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language): Combines neural and symbolic modules\n4. **Plan-and-Execute**: Creates a plan first, then executes steps\n\n### Real-World Applications\n\nLLM agents can be applied to various domains:\n\n1. **Research assistants** that search, summarize, and synthesize information\n2. **Coding assistants** that write, debug, and explain code\n3. **Data analysis agents** that clean, visualize, and interpret data\n4. **Customer service agents** that handle queries and perform actions\n5. **Personal assistants** that manage schedules, emails, and tasks\n\n### Project Ideas\n\nHere are some practical agent projects you could build:\n\n1. **Study buddy agent**: Helps create flashcards, generates practice questions, and explains concepts\n2. **Job application assistant**: Searches job listings, tailors resumes, and prepares interview responses\n3. **Personal finance agent**: Categorizes expenses, suggests budgets, and identifies savings opportunities\n4. **Health and fitness coach**: Creates workout plans, tracks nutrition, and provides motivation\n5. **Course project helper**: Breaks down assignments, suggests resources, and reviews work\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. **Clear instructions**: Define the agent's capabilities and limitations\n2. **Effective tool design**: Create tools that are specific and reliable\n3. **Robust error handling**: Agents should recover gracefully from failures\n4. **Memory management**: Balance context retention with token efficiency\n5. **User feedback**: Allow users to correct or guide the agent\n\n### Limitations and Challenges\n\nCurrent LLM agents face several challenges:\n\n1. **Hallucination**: Agents may generate false information or tool calls\n2. **Planning limitations**: Complex tasks require better planning capabilities\n3. **Tool integration complexity**: Each new tool adds implementation overhead\n4. **Context window constraints**: Limited memory for long-running tasks\n5. **Security concerns**: Tool access requires careful permission management\n",

Students will learn how to create and test prompts systematically to achieve desired outputs.\n\n* **\"with PromptFoo\":** This indicates that the video uses or is associated with a tool or platform called \"PromptFoo.\"  This suggests the video likely uses PromptFoo to demonstrate the techniques being taught.  Students should expect to see the PromptFoo interface and learn how to use it (or similar tools) in their workflow.\n\n* **\"(12 min)\":** This clearly states the video's duration, indicating a concise and focused learning experience.

This approach works with any visible screen content and bypasses traditional web scraping limitations like authentication or anti-scraping measures.\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"Screen Scraping with Gemini\" suggests an educational image explaining the concept of screen scraping using the Gemini framework (or potentially a tool named Gemini).  The image likely depicts a visual representation of this process. To assist students, here's a breakdown of what the image might show and what concepts it aims to illustrate:\n\n**Possible Content of the Image:**\n\n* **Website Screenshot:** A partial or full screenshot of a website. This is the target from which data will be extracted.  The important parts of the website, the elements being scraped, might be highlighted or have annotations.\n* **Gemini Code Snippet:**  A segment of code written in the Gemini framework demonstrating how to select and extract specific data points from the website. This code might use selectors (like CSS selectors or XPath) to target particular elements such as `<p>`, `<div>`, or `<span>` tags within the HTML.  The code might show how to access text content, attributes (like `href` for links), or other data within those elements.\n* **Data Extraction Representation:**  A visual representation of the data being extracted. This could be a table, a list, or a simple representation showing how the raw HTML data is transformed into structured data (e.g., a CSV file or a database record).\n* **Flowchart or Diagram:** A flowchart illustrating the steps involved in screen scraping with Gemini. This might include steps like:\n    * Identifying the target website.\n    * Inspecting the website's HTML structure.\n    * Writing Gemini code to select elements.\n    * Extracting the data.\n    * Cleaning and processing the extracted data.\n* **Comparison with Manual Data Entry:** Possibly a comparison highlighting the efficiency and automation gained by screen scraping versus manual data copying.\n\n\n**Concepts the Image Aims to Teach:**\n\n* **Web Scraping:**  The general concept of automatically extracting data from websites.\n* **Screen Scraping (a type of web scraping):**  Specifically focusing on extracting data directly from the rendered HTML of a website, as opposed to using APIs.\n* **Gemini Framework (or tool):**  The specific library or tool used to accomplish the screen scraping task. The image would showcase its functionality.\n* **HTML Structure:** Understanding the basic structure of HTML and how to identify elements within it using selectors.\n* **Data Extraction Techniques:** Showing how to select and extract different types of data from HTML elements (text, attributes, etc.).\n* **Automation:** Emphasizing the automated nature of screen scraping and its benefits compared to manual processes.\n* **Ethical Considerations (possibly):**  If the image is comprehensive, it might subtly or explicitly address ethical aspects of web scraping, such as respecting website terms of service, robots.txt, and avoiding overloading the target server.\n\n\n**How to Use the Image for Learning:**\n\nStudents should focus on:\n\n1. **Identifying the Target Website:** What website is being scraped?\n2. **Understanding the Code:**  If code is shown, what selectors are used? What functions extract the data?\n3. **Tracing the Data Flow:** How does the raw data from the website become organized and usable data?\n4. **Appreciating Automation:** How does the Gemini framework simplify the data extraction process compared to manual copying?\n\nBy carefully examining these aspects, students can gain a practical understanding of screen scraping with the Gemini framework (or tool).]](https://youtu.be/2G1LqS6qO5s)\n\nKey benefits:\n\n- No setup cost or authentication handling\n- Works with any visible screen content\n- Full control over data exposure\n- Extremely cost-effective (< $0.001 per short video)\n- Bypasses anti-scraping measures\n- Handles varying formats and layouts\n\n### Quick Start Example\n\nHere's a basic workflow using Google's AI Studio and Gemini:\n\n1. **Record the Screen**\n   - Use QuickTime (Mac) or Windows Game Bar (Windows), Screen2Gif, or any tool of your choice\n   - Select specific screen area containing target data\n   - Record scrolling/clicking through content\n   - Keep recordings short (30-60 seconds)\n2. **Process with Gemini**\n   - Upload to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/prompts)\n   - Select Gemini 1.5 Flash (cost-effective)\n   - Prompt for structured output (JSON/CSV)\n\nExample prompt for extracting tabular data:\n\n```text\nTurn this video into a JSON array where each item has:\n{\n  \"date\": \"yyyy-mm-dd\",\n  \"amount\": float\n}\n```\n\n### Cost Calculation\n\nGemini 1.5 Flash pricing (as of January 2025):\n\n- $0.075 per million tokens\n- Cost per frame ~ 250 tokens\n- Cost for 24 hours of video at 1 frame per second ~ $1.62!\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. **Recording Quality**\n   - Frame only relevant content\n   - Pause briefly on important data\n   - Maintain consistent scroll speed\n   - Use high contrast display settings\n2. **Data Validation**\n   - Always verify critical data manually\n   - Use spot-checking for large datasets\n   - Consider running multiple passes\n   - Log and review any anomalies\n3. **Error Handling**\n   - Request data in simple formats (CSV/JSON)\n   - Include validation in prompts\n   - Split long videos into segments\n   - Handle missing/partial data gracefully\n\n### Use Cases\n\n1. **Data Extraction**\n   - Email content aggregation\n   - Dashboard metrics collection\n   - Protected web content\n   - Legacy system data\n2. **Data Journalism**\n   - Public records analysis\n   - Time-series data collection\n   - Interactive visualization data\n   - Government website scraping\n3. **Business Intelligence**\n   - Competitor pricing analysis\n   - Market research data\n   - Internal system migration\n   - Legacy report conversion\n\nTools:\n\n- [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts): Process videos with Gemini\n- [QuickTime Player](https://support.apple.com/guide/quicktime-player/welcome/mac): Screen recording (Mac)\n- [Screen2Gif](https://www.screentogif.com/): Screen recording (Windows)\n- [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/): Advanced screen recording (cross-platform)\n\nReferences:\n\n- [Simon Willison's Video Scraping Tutorial](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/17/video-scraping/)\n- [Gemini API Documentation](https://ai.google.dev/docs)\n",

The image likely depicts one or more of the following:\n\n* **A terminal window:**  This would be the main focus, showing command-line code interacting with a language model.  The code might involve prompts being sent to the model, and the model's responses being displayed.  Expect to see text output typical of a command line interface (CLI).\n\n* **Simon Willison (possibly):** The image might include a small picture or mention of Simon Willison himself, perhaps in a corner or as a watermark, to indicate the source of the tutorial.\n\n* **Specific commands/tools:** The code in the terminal might highlight specific tools or libraries used for command-line interaction with LLMs.  These could include names like `openai`, `langchain`,  or others depending on the specific technologies used.\n\n* **Example prompts and responses:**  The terminal window might show example prompts given to the language model (e.g., \"Write a haiku about cats\") and the corresponding responses generated by the model.  This visual example would be crucial for understanding the process.\n\n* **Diagram or flowchart (less likely):**  While less probable, a simplified diagram could explain the interaction flow between the command line, the chosen tool, and the language model API.\n\n\nIn summary, for students, the image serves as a visual representation of a practical, hands-on approach to using powerful language models.  It emphasizes the command-line interface, making it clear that this method avoids graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and allows for direct interaction and scripting.  The presence of Simon Willison suggests a reputable source and a likely well-structured educational resource.]](https://youtu.be/QUXQNi6jQ30?t=100)\n\n### Basic Usage\n\n[Install llm](https://github.com/simonw/llm#installation). Then set up your [`OPENAI_API_KEY`](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) environment variable. See [Getting started](https://github.com/simonw/llm?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started).\n\n**TDS Students**: See [Large Language Models](large-language-models.md) for instructions on how to get and use `OPENAI_API_KEY`.\n\n```bash\n# Run a simple prompt\nllm 'five great names for a pet pelican'\n\n# Continue a conversation\nllm -c 'now do walruses'\n\n# Start a memory-aware chat session\nllm chat\n\n# Specify a model\nllm -m gpt-4.1-nano 'Summarize tomorrow’s meeting agenda'\n\n# Extract JSON output\nllm 'List the top 5 Python viz libraries with descriptions' \\\n  --schema-multi 'name,description'\n```\n\nOr use llm without installation using [`uvx`](uv.md):\n\n```bash\n# Run llm via uvx without any prior installation\nuvx llm 'Translate \"Hello, world\" into Japanese'\n\n# Specify a model\nuvx llm -m gpt-4.1-nano 'Draft a 200-word blog post on data ethics'\n\n# Use structured JSON output\nuvx llm 'List the top 5 programming languages in 2025 with their release years' \\\n  --schema-multi 'rank,language,release_year'\n```\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Interactive prompts**: `llm '…'` — Fast shell access to any LLM.\n- **Conversational flow**: `-c '…'` — Continue context across prompts.\n- **Model switching**: `-m MODEL` — Use OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, and more.\n- **Structured output**: `llm json` — Produce JSON for automation.\n- **Logging & history**: `llm logs path` — Persist every prompt/response in SQLite.\n- **Web UI**: `datasette \"$(llm logs path)\"` — Browse your entire history with Datasette.\n- **Persistent chat**: `llm chat` — Keep the model in memory across multiple interactions.\n- **Plugin ecosystem**: `llm install PLUGIN` — Add support for new models, data sources, or workflows. ([Language models on the command-line - Simon Willison's Weblog](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n### Practical Uses\n\n- **Automated coding**. Generate code scaffolding, review helpers, or utilities on demand. For example, after running`llm install llm-cmd`, run `llm cmd 'Undo the last git commit'`. Inspired by [Simon’s post on using LLMs for rapid tool building](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/).\n- **Transcript processing**. Summarize YouTube or podcast transcripts using Gemini. See [Putting Gemini 2.5 Pro through its paces](https://www.macstories.net/mac/llm-youtube-transcripts-with-claude-and-gemini-in-shortcuts/).\n- **Commit messages**. Turn diffs into descriptive commit messages, e.g. `git diff | llm 'Write a concise git commit message explaining these changes'`. \\\n- **Data extraction**. Convert free-text into structured JSON for automation. [Structured data extraction from unstructured content using LLM schemas](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/28/llm-schemas/).\n",

    "content": "## Interactive Notebooks: Marimo\n\n[Marimo](https://marimo.app/) is a new take on notebooks that solves some headaches of Jupyter. It runs cells reactively - when you change one cell, all dependent cells update automatically, just like a spreadsheet.\n\nMarimo's cells can't be run out of order. This makes Marimo more reproducible and easier to debug, but requires a mental shift from the Jupyter/Colab way of working.\n\nIt also runs Python directly in the browser and is quite interactive. [Browse the gallery of examples](https://marimo.io/gallery). With a wide variety of interactive widgets, It's growing popular as an alternative to Streamlit for building data science web apps.\n\nCommon Operations:\n\n```python\n# Create new notebook\nuvx marimo new\n\n# Run notebook server\nuvx marimo edit notebook.py\n\n# Export to HTML\nuvx marimo export notebook.py\n```\n\nBest Practices:\n\n1. **Cell Dependencies**\n   - Keep cells focused and atomic\n   - Use clear variable names\n   - Document data flow between cells\n2. **Interactive Elements**\n\n   ```python\n   # Add interactive widgets\n   slider = mo.ui.slider(1, 100)\n   # Create dynamic Markdown\n   mo.md(f\"{slider} {\"🟢\" * slider.value}\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Version Control**\n   - Keep notebooks are Python files\n   - Use Git to track changes\n   - Publish on [marimo.app](https://marimo.app/) for collaboration\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text describes an image likely showing a screenshot or visual representation of \"Marimo,\" an open-source, reactive notebook for Python.  The image probably showcases the software's interface, highlighting its features relevant to coding and data science in Python.\n\nFor students, here's what they might expect to see in the image:\n\n* **A Notebook Interface:**  The core of the image will likely be a window resembling a Jupyter Notebook or similar interactive coding environment.  This would involve cells for writing and executing Python code, displaying outputs (text, tables, plots, etc.), and potentially markdown cells for documentation or explanations.\n\n* **Reactive Programming Hints:** The image might subtly or explicitly demonstrate the \"reactive\" aspect. This could be shown through:\n    * **Automatic updates:**  Perhaps a change in one code cell automatically triggers recalculations or updates in other dependent cells.\n    * **Visual feedback:**  The interface might use color-coding, highlighting, or other visual cues to indicate data flow or dependencies between code blocks.\n    * **Real-time visualizations:**  Dynamic charts or graphs updating in response to code execution would highlight the reactivity.\n\n* **Python Code Examples:** The image will almost certainly show some snippets of Python code within the notebook cells, possibly demonstrating common data manipulation, analysis, or visualization tasks.  These could serve as examples of how to use Marimo.\n\n* **Branding or Attribution:**  The image might include subtle branding (a logo or name) associated with Marimo or possibly mention \"Akshay Agrawal (Nbpy2024)\"  again, confirming the source and potentially referencing a presentation or conference (Nbpy2024 likely suggests a Python notebook conference in 2024).\n\nIn short, the image is designed to visually represent the functionality and appeal of Marimo as a tool for Python programming and data science, particularly highlighting its unique reactive capabilities.  Students should look for evidence of interactivity, automatic updates, and clean presentation of code and results.]](https://youtu.be/9R2cQygaoxQ)\n",

    "content": "## Narratives with Excel\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"Narratives with Excel\" suggests an image demonstrating how Microsoft Excel can be used to support or create narratives.  Without seeing the image itself, I can only speculate on its possible content, offering several scenarios a student might encounter:\n\n**Possible Image Contents & Explanations:**\n\n* **Scenario 1: Data Visualization leading to a Story:** The image might show an Excel spreadsheet with data (e.g., sales figures, survey results, population statistics) alongside a visually compelling chart or graph (bar chart, line graph, pie chart).  Arrows or annotations could connect specific data points in the spreadsheet to key elements of the narrative presented in the chart/graph.  The narrative itself might be summarized in a text box nearby, explaining the story the data tells (e.g., \"Sales increased by 20% in Q3 due to a successful marketing campaign\").  This scenario highlights how Excel helps to analyze data and then communicate the findings effectively in a narrative form.\n\n* **Scenario 2: Excel as a Storytelling Tool:** The image might show examples of Excel features used for storytelling, such as conditional formatting (highlighting important data points), data tables clearly structured for readability, or the use of formulas to calculate key narrative elements.  For example, it might showcase a spreadsheet tracking a character's journey in a story, using formulas to calculate distance traveled, time elapsed, etc. This scenario emphasizes Excel's capacity beyond simple calculations, showing how it can aid in organizing and managing information for narrative construction.\n\n* **Scenario 3: Comparing Narratives with Excel:** The image could show two different Excel sheets, each presenting data related to the same narrative topic but from different perspectives or with different analyses.  This could be used to illustrate how different interpretations of the same data can lead to varied narratives.  This scenario encourages critical thinking about data interpretation and narrative construction.\n\n* **Scenario 4: A Workflow Diagram:** The image might be a flowchart illustrating the steps involved in using Excel to support narrative creation, starting from data collection and ending with the final presentation of the narrative.  This would provide a practical guide for students on how to integrate Excel into their narrative-building process.\n\n\n**For Student Assistance:**\n\nTo help students understand the image, regardless of its specific content, encourage them to consider these questions:\n\n* **What type of data is presented in the Excel spreadsheet?**\n* **How is the data visualized (charts, graphs, tables)?**\n* **What story does the data tell? How does the image demonstrate this?**\n* **What Excel features are used to support or create the narrative?**\n* **What are the advantages of using Excel for this purpose?**\n* **What other tools or methods could be used to create a similar narrative? How does Excel compare?**\n\n\nBy prompting these questions, students can actively engage with the image and extract its meaning, even without a direct description of its visual elements.]](https://youtu.be/CRNJerr3pI4)\n\n- [Sample Excel](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Htmr5ar0ZX2nYW8Xerr9OaLJl3zS0gxY/view#gid=171350107)\n",

The image likely contains elements illustrating this topic.  Here's a breakdown of what the image might depict to help students:\n\n**Possible elements within the image:**\n\n* **Title/Heading:**  \"Exploring the Movie Actor Network in Python\" or a similar title prominently displayed.\n* **Network Graph:** The most likely central element. This would be a visual representation of a network, where:\n    * **Nodes:** Represent actors.  These could be labeled with actor names (perhaps abbreviated) or just shown as points.\n    * **Edges:** Represent connections between actors, likely indicating they've appeared in the same movie.  The thickness of the edges might represent the number of films they've shared, or the strength of their connection. The color of the edges might also convey additional information (e.g., genre of films they worked on together).\n    * **Layout:** The arrangement of the nodes and edges; likely a force-directed layout (nodes repel each other but are connected by edges) to show clusters and important actors.\n* **Python Code Snippets:** Small sections of Python code demonstrating how the network was created and analyzed.  This might include libraries like `NetworkX` or similar graph manipulation tools.  Expect to see code related to:\n    * **Data Import:** Reading data (likely from a CSV or other file) containing actor-movie pairings.\n    * **Network Creation:** Building the graph structure using `NetworkX` functions.\n    * **Network Analysis:** Code snippets showing centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness), community detection, or pathfinding algorithms.\n* **Data Visualization Libraries:** Mention or depiction of libraries like `Matplotlib` or `Seaborn` (for creating the graph), or perhaps `Plotly` (for interactive visualizations).\n* **Results/Insights:** Textual or graphical summaries of the analysis. This could include things like:\n    * **Centrality Measures:** Highlighting actors with high degrees (many connections), betweenness centrality (actors bridging different groups), or closeness centrality (actors easily reachable from others).\n    * **Community Detection:** Showing clusters of actors frequently working together.\n    * **Pathfinding:** Illustrating the shortest path between two actors.\n\n\n**How students can use this image for learning:**\n\nThe image serves as a visual summary of a complex topic. Students can use it to:\n\n* **Understand the concept of actor networks:** How movie collaborations create interconnected relationships.\n* **Visualize network data:** See how abstract data is translated into a meaningful graph.\n* **Learn about Python libraries:** Identify the tools used for network analysis and visualization.\n* **Interpret network analysis results:** Understand the meaning of centrality measures and community detection.\n* **Connect theory to practice:** See how theoretical concepts are applied in a real-world example.\n\n\nIn short, the image is likely a visually engaging summary of a Python-based network analysis project focused on the collaborative relationships between movie actors.  It aims to illustrate the power of network analysis and Python programming for exploring complex datasets.]](https://youtu.be/uPL3VuRqOy4)\n\nYou'll learn how to use network analysis to identify clusters and connections between nodes in a dataset, covering:\n\n- **Network Construction**: Build a network from the IMDB database, where nodes represent actors and edges represent shared movie appearances.\n- **Clustering**: Apply clustering techniques to detect communities within the network, using scikit-learn's network library.\n- **Matrix Operations**: Utilize matrix operations to efficiently analyze actor relationships and interactions.\n- **Community Detection**: Implement algorithms to identify and interpret clusters, examining how different actor clusters are connected.\n- **Application of Findings**: Explore practical applications of network analysis, such as social network analysis and its potential uses in various domains.\n\nHere are links used in the video:\n\n- [Jupyter Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VRlAOfREGwflv7v2VmN-6O_wqRno4Xcq?usp=sharing)\n- [Exploring the Movie Actor Network in Python](https://youtu.be/6hzLw80qxto)\n- [Jupyter Notebook - Shortest Path](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-b0pA1O6rCS-ZwU_MWdCzx0CEI_WnyZ2)\n- [Jupyter Notebook - Actor network](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Lps2fkRlyPAnR63hDOihzCaMvo_RU6Ds)\n- [IMDb Datasets](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/)\n- Learn about the [`sknetwork` package](https://scikit-network.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use_cases/votes.html)\n- Learn about the [scipy.sparse matrices](https://cmdlinetips.com/2018/03/sparse-matrices-in-python-with-scipy/) and [video](https://youtu.be/v_S7cOL5ZWU)\n- [Introduction to Kumu](https://youtu.be/fwiz7PnipgQ)\n- [Network analysis with Kumu](https://docs.kumu.io/guides/disciplines/sna-network-mapping)\n- [Introduction to Systems and Network Mapping with Kumu](https://www.coursera.org/projects/systems-network-kumu)\n",

The image likely uses a visual metaphor or a simplified diagram to illustrate the core concept.  Without seeing the image, I can only speculate on its contents, but it might include elements like:\n\n* **A visual representation of a local network:**  This could be a simple box labeled \"Local Machine\" or \"Your Computer\" with icons representing applications or services running locally (e.g., a web server).\n\n* **A depiction of ngrok's tunnel:**  This would likely show a tunnel or a secure connection linking the local network to the internet. This tunnel might be represented by a stylized line or pipe, possibly with a padlock icon to indicate security.\n\n* **A cloud symbol representing the internet:** A cloud icon is standard imagery for representing the internet.\n\n* **A public URL:**  This might be displayed at the internet's end of the tunnel, indicating the publicly accessible URL that ngrok provides to access the local service.  It might be presented as something like `https://abcdef12345.ngrok.io`.\n\n* **Arrows indicating data flow:** Arrows should show the direction of data flow, starting from a local application, moving through the ngrok tunnel, and reaching the internet and vice-versa.\n\n* **A concise explanation:** The image may incorporate short text labels explaining each component, such as \"Local Web Server,\" \"ngrok Tunnel,\" \"Public Internet,\" and \"Public URL.\"\n\nIn essence, the image aims to convey the idea that ngrok creates a secure tunnel that exposes locally running applications to the internet, providing a public URL to access them securely without needing to configure complex networking setups. The \"60 seconds\" in the alt text implies a very quick and easy-to-understand explanation of this process.]](https://youtu.be/dfMdLGZLXSg)\n\nRun the command `uvx ngrok http 8000` to create a tunnel to your local server on port 8000.

To help students, we need to imagine what it might contain. The image probably demonstrates one or more of the following:\n\n* **Data Visualization:** A scatter plot or other chart (e.g., box plot, histogram) within the Excel sheet visually highlighting data points significantly distant from the majority of the data – these are the outliers.  The outliers might be colored differently, circled, or otherwise emphasized.  The chart's axes would label the variables being analyzed.\n\n* **Calculated Statistics:** The spreadsheet would probably show calculated statistics relevant to outlier detection, like mean, median, standard deviation, or interquartile range (IQR).  Formulas might be visible in the cells, showing how these values were computed.  Students could see how these statistics are used to identify outliers, perhaps using methods like the Z-score or IQR method.\n\n* **Outlier Identification:** The spreadsheet might directly identify outliers by labeling them or flagging them with notes or conditional formatting.  There might be a separate column indicating whether each data point is an outlier or not, based on a chosen threshold or method.\n\n* **Example Data:**  The data itself is likely presented in tabular format, with rows representing individual data points and columns representing different variables.  The data might be simple numerical values or could represent a more complex dataset relevant to a specific field of study (e.g., sales figures, student test scores, or scientific measurements).\n\n\n**For student assistance, here's how to interpret such an image:**\n\n* **Identify the Method:**  Look for clues about how outliers are identified.  Are Z-scores used?  Is the IQR method apparent (1.5 * IQR above Q3 or below Q1)? Or is a visual inspection the primary method?\n\n* **Understand the Context:** What kind of data is being analyzed? Understanding the data context will help interpret the significance of the outliers.\n\n* **Analyze the Results:** How many outliers are there? Are they clustered together or spread out?  What are the potential reasons for these outliers? Are they errors in data entry, unusual events, or genuinely extreme values?\n\n* **Consider Implications:** What are the implications of these outliers for further analysis or decision-making? Should they be excluded from further calculations?  If so, why?  What are the ethical considerations involved in excluding data?\n\nIn short, the image aims to illustrate the practical application of outlier detection techniques within a familiar tool like Excel, making the concept more accessible to students.  The key is to analyze the visual representation, the calculated statistics, and the method used to identify those data points deemed outliers.]](https://youtu.be/sUTJb0F9eBw)\n\nYou'll learn how to identify and handle outliers in data using Excel, covering:\n\n- **Understanding Outliers**: Definition of outliers and their impact on statistical analysis.\n- **Calculating Quartiles**: Using Excel formulas to calculate Q1 (first quartile) and Q3 (third quartile).\n- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Finding the IQR by subtracting Q1 from Q3.\n- **Determining Bounds**: Calculating lower and upper bounds using 1.5 times the IQR.\n- **Identifying Outliers**: Using Excel functions to determine if data points fall outside the calculated bounds.\n- **Visualizing Data**: Creating box plots to visualize outliers and data distribution.\n- **Handling Outliers**: Deciding whether to exclude or keep outliers based on their impact on analysis.\n\nHere are the links used in the video:\n\n- [Understand distributions and outliers](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/quantitative-data-ap/xfb5d8e68:describing-distribution-quant/v/classifying-distributions)\n- [COVID-19 vaccinations data - Excel](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_vQF2i5ubKmHQMBqoTwsu6AlevWsQtTD/view#gid=790744269)\n",

    "content": "## Parsing JSON\n\nJSON is everywhere—APIs, logs, configuration files—and its nested or large structure can challenge memory and processing. In this tutorial, we'll explore tools to flatten, stream, and query JSON data efficiently.\n\nFor example, we'll often need to process a multi-gigabyte log file from a web service where each record is a JSON object.\n\n[[Image Description: The image \"JSON Parsing in Python\" likely depicts a visual explanation of how to process JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data using Python programming language.  Since I cannot see the image, I can only offer potential content that might be included:\n\n**Possible elements the image could contain:**\n\n* **Code snippets:**  The image probably shows Python code examples using libraries like `json` to parse JSON data. This could include:\n    * `import json`:  The line importing the necessary library.\n    * `json.loads()` function:  This function converts a JSON string into a Python dictionary or list. The image might show the JSON string as input and the resulting Python data structure as output.\n    * `json.dumps()` function: This function converts a Python dictionary or list back into a JSON string.  This might be shown to illustrate the reverse process.\n    * Error handling: The image might demonstrate how to handle potential errors during parsing, such as malformed JSON data.  This could involve `try...except` blocks.\n    * Accessing data within the parsed JSON:  The image could show how to access specific elements within the resulting Python dictionary or list using indexing and key access (e.g., `my_dict[\"key\"]`).\n    * Iterating through JSON data:  Examples of using loops (like `for` loops) to process large JSON datasets.\n\n* **Diagram:**  A diagram might visually represent the transformation of JSON data into a Python object.  This could be a flowchart showing the steps involved or a side-by-side comparison of the JSON structure and its Python equivalent.  Arrows might connect elements showing the mapping between them.\n\n* **Data structure illustration:** The image might show the difference between JSON's key-value pairs and nested structures and how they are represented as dictionaries and nested dictionaries or lists in Python.\n\n* **Example JSON Data:**  A sample JSON string would be displayed to illustrate the input to the Python code.  This would likely be a well-formatted JSON object, potentially representing something like a product catalog, user data, or other structured information.\n\n\n**For student assistance, emphasize these points:**\n\n* **The `json` module:**  Stress the importance of the `json` module and its functions for efficiently handling JSON data in Python.\n* **Data types:** Explain how JSON data types (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects) map to Python data types (strings, numbers, booleans, lists, dictionaries).\n* **Error handling:**  Highlight the significance of handling potential errors during JSON parsing, such as invalid JSON format.\n* **Readability and clarity:** Encourage students to write clean and well-commented code for better understanding and maintainability.\n* **Practice:**  Recommend practicing with different JSON datasets to reinforce understanding.\n\n\nWithout the actual image, this is a general description.  However, it should help students understand what to look for and what concepts are likely being illustrated.]](https://youtu.be/1lxrb_ezP-g)\n\nThis requires us to handle complex nested structures, large files that don't fit in memory, or extract specific fields. Here are the key tools and techniques for efficient JSON parsing:\n\n| Tool                                        | Extract from JSON...   | Why                                                               |\n| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [jq](#command-line-json-processing-with-jq) | JSON in the shell      | Quick data exploration and pipeline processing                    |\n| [JMESPath](#jmespath-queries)               | JSON in Python         | Handle complex queries with a clean syntax                        |\n| [ijson](#streaming-with-ijson)              | JSON streams in Python | Parse streaming/large JSON files memory-efficiently               |\n| [Pandas](#pandas-json-columns)              | JSON columns in Python | Fast analysis of structured data                                  |\n| [SQL JSON](#sql-json-functions)             | JSON in databases      | Combine structured and semi-structured data                       |\n| [DuckDB](#duckdb-json-processing)           | JSON anywhere          | Fast analysis of JSON files / databases without loading to memory |\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Use Pandas when you need to transform API responses into a DataFrame for further analysis.\n- Leverage ijson when dealing with huge JSON logs where memory is at a premium.\n- Apply jq for quick, iterative exploration directly in your terminal.\n\nPractice with these resources:\n\n- [JSONPath Online Evaluator](https://jsonpath.com/): Test JSON queries\n- [jq play](https://jqplay.org/): Interactive jq query testing\n- [DuckDB JSON Tutorial](https://duckdb.org/docs/data/json): Learn DuckDB JSON functions\n\n### Command-line JSON Processing with jq\n\n[jq](https://jqlang.org/) is a versatile command-line tool for slicing, filtering, and transforming JSON. It excels in quick data exploration and can be integrated into shell scripts for automated data pipelines.\n\n**Example:** Sifting through server logs in JSON Lines format to extract error messages or aggregate metrics without launching a full-scale ETL process.\n\n```bash\n# Extract specific fields from JSONL\ncat data.jsonl | jq -c 'select(.type == \"user\") | {id, name}'\n\n# Transform JSON structure\ncat data.json | jq '.items[] | {name: .name, count: .details.count}'\n\n# Filter and aggregate\ncat events.jsonl | jq -s 'group_by(.category) | map({category: .[0].category, count: length})'\n```\n\n### JMESPath Queries\n\n[JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/) offers a declarative query language to extract and transform data from nested JSON structures without needing verbose code. It's a neat alternative when you want to quickly pull out specific values or filter collections based on conditions.\n\n**Example:** Extracting user emails or filtering out inactive records from a complex JSON payload received from a cloud service.\n\n```python\nimport jmespath\n\n# Example queries\ndata = {\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\"name\": \"Seattle\", \"state\": \"WA\", \"info\": {\"population\": 737015}},\n        {\"name\": \"Portland\", \"state\": \"OR\", \"info\": {\"population\": 652503}}\n    ]\n}\n\n# Find all cities with population > 700000\ncities = jmespath.search(\"locations[?info.population > `700000`].name\", data)\n```\n\n### Streaming with ijson\n\nLoading huge JSON files all at once can quickly exhaust system memory. [ijson](https://ijson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) lets you stream and process JSON incrementally. This method is ideal when your JSON file is too large or when you only need to work with part of the data.\n\n**Example:** Processing a continuous feed from an API that returns a large JSON array, such as sensor data or event logs, while filtering on the fly.\n\n```python\nimport ijson\n\nasync def process_large_json(filepath: str) -> list:\n    \"\"\"Process a large JSON file without loading it entirely into memory.\"\"\"\n    results = []\n\n    with open(filepath, 'rb') as file:\n        # Stream objects under the 'items' key\n        parser = ijson.items(file, 'items.item')\n        async for item in parser:\n            if item['value'] > 100:  # Process conditionally\n                results.append(item)\n\n    return results\n```\n\n### Pandas JSON Columns\n\n[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) makes it easy to work with tabular data that includes JSON strings. When you receive API data where one column holds nested JSON, flattening these structures lets you analyze and visualize the data using familiar DataFrame operations.\n\n**Example:** Flattening customer records stored as nested JSON in a CSV file to extract demographic details and spending patterns.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Parse JSON strings in a column\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'json_col': ['{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}', '{\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25}']})\ndf['parsed'] = df['json_col'].apply(pd.json_normalize)\n\n# Normalize nested JSON columns\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\ndf_normalized = pd.json_normalize(\n    df['nested_json'].apply(json.loads),\n    record_path=['items'],        # List of nested objects to unpack\n    meta=['id', 'timestamp']      # Keep these columns from parent\n)\n```\n\n### SQL JSON Functions\n\n[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2016) supports built-in JSON functions allow you to query and manipulate JSON stored within relational databases.\nThese are implemented by most popular databases, including\n[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html),\n[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html), and\n[MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/json-function-reference.html).\nThis is especially handy when you have a hybrid data model, combining structured tables with semi-structured JSON columns.\n\n**Example:** An application that stores user settings or application logs as JSON in a SQLite database, enabling quick lookups and modifications without external JSON parsing libraries.\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    json_extract(data, '$.name') as name,\n    json_extract(data, '$.details.age') as age\nFROM users\nWHERE json_extract(data, '$.active') = true\n```\n\n### DuckDB JSON Processing\n\n[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) shines when analyzing JSON/JSONL files directly, making it a powerful tool for data analytics without the overhead of loading entire datasets into memory. Its SQL-like syntax simplifies exploratory analysis on nested data.\n\n**Example:** Performing ad-hoc analytics on streaming JSON logs from a web service, such as calculating average response times or aggregating user behavior metrics.\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    json_extract_string(data, '$.user.name') as name,\n    avg(json_extract_float(data, '$.metrics.value')) as avg_value\nFROM read_json_auto('data/*.jsonl')\nGROUP BY 1\nHAVING avg_value > 100\n```\n",

    "content": "## Profile Data with Python\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"Discover the data profile with Python\" suggests an educational image illustrating how to use Python to analyze and understand the characteristics of a dataset – a process known as data profiling.  Without seeing the image itself, I can only speculate on its potential content, but here are some possibilities it might depict:\n\n**Possible Image Content & Explanations for Students:**\n\n* **Code Snippet:** The image might show a Python code snippet using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, or similar, demonstrating functions used for data profiling.  This could include:\n    * **`df.describe()`:**  A line of code showing the basic descriptive statistics of a DataFrame (like mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).  The explanation for students would highlight how this provides a quick overview of the data's central tendency and dispersion.\n    * **`df.info()`:**  This would display information about the DataFrame's columns, including data types and the number of non-null values. The explanation should emphasize its use in identifying missing data and data type inconsistencies.\n    * **Data visualization using Matplotlib or Seaborn:** A simple histogram or box plot generated from the data, showing the distribution of a particular variable.  Students should understand how visualization helps in identifying outliers, skewness, and the overall shape of the data.\n    * **Data quality checks:** The code could include functions that check for null values, duplicates, or inconsistent data formats. Explanations would emphasize the importance of data cleansing before analysis.\n\n* **Diagram:** A flowchart or diagram might illustrate the steps involved in data profiling with Python. This could include steps like:\n    * **Data loading:** Importing the data into a Pandas DataFrame.\n    * **Data inspection:** Using functions like `df.head()`, `df.tail()`, and `df.sample()` to get a glimpse of the data.\n    * **Descriptive statistics:** Calculating summary statistics.\n    * **Data visualization:** Creating plots to understand the data distribution.\n    * **Data quality assessment:** Identifying and handling missing values and inconsistencies.\n\n* **Screenshot:** A screenshot of a Jupyter Notebook or other Python IDE showing the code and its output. This would provide a real-world context for students, showing how the code is executed and what the results look like.\n\n**Regardless of the specific content, the image aims to teach students:**\n\n* **The importance of data profiling:** Before any data analysis can begin, it's crucial to understand the data's characteristics, including its size, data types, distribution, and quality.\n* **How Python can be used for data profiling:** Python, along with its powerful libraries, provides efficient tools for data profiling tasks.\n* **Specific Python libraries and functions:**  Students should learn to use libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data profiling.\n* **Interpreting the results of data profiling:** Students need to understand how to interpret the summary statistics and visualizations generated by the code.\n\n\nIn summary, the image likely provides a practical demonstration of how to perform data profiling using Python, equipping students with the knowledge and skills to analyze and understand their datasets effectively.]](https://youtu.be/kFVxdBhLa_A)\n\nThis session covers the use of the `pandas_profiling` library for generating comprehensive data reports in Python:\n\n- **Library Installation and Import**: Learn how to install and import the pandas_profiling library.\n- **Profile Report Generation**: Generate an HTML report with a single line of code using ProfileReport.\n- **Descriptive Statistics**: View detailed descriptive statistics such as variance, standard deviation, and kurtosis.\n- **Outlier Detection**: Identify and analyze outliers within the dataset.\n- **Correlation Analysis**: Understand how variables are correlated with each other using visual representations.\n- **Handling Missing Values**: Get insights on missing data and decide on imputation or removal strategies.\n- **Initial Data Insights**: Use the report to gather early warnings and insights before starting the data cleaning and modeling process.\n\nHere are links used in the video:\n\n- [Jupyter Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hFo_zvBuKw_ugxRjX4XUSh65-hAvl7X0)\n- [Pandas Profiling output](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cqu52zgddCJqzbLd7xqDC2RXPNkufFlN/view)\n- Learn about the [`pandas_profiling` package](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-profiling).

    "content": "# Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent\n\nThis project is due on 16 Feb 2025 EoD IST. Results will be announced by 26 Feb 2025.\n\nFor questions, [use this Discourse thread](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277).\n\n## Background\n\nYou have joined the operations team at **DataWorks Solutions**, a company that processes large volumes of log files, reports, and code artifacts to generate actionable insights for internal stakeholders. In order to improve operational efficiency and consistency, the company has mandated that routine tasks be automated and integrated into their Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.\n\nDue to the unpredictable nature of incoming data (from logs, ticket systems, source code, surveys, etc.) the team has decided to use a Large Language Model (LLM) as an intermediate transformer. In this role, the LLM will perform small, reasonably deterministic tasks.\n\nYour assignment is to build an automation agent that accepts plain‑English tasks, carries out the required (multi‑step) process leveraging an LLM where required. The finished processing artifacts must be exactly verifiable against pre‑computed expected results.\n\n## Create an API\n\nWrite an application that exposes an API with the following endpoints:\n\n- **POST `/run?task=<task description>`**\n  Executes a plain‑English task. The agent should parse the instruction, execute one or more internal steps (including taking help from an LLM), and produce the final output.\n  - If successful, return a HTTP 200 OK response\n  - If unsuccessful because of an error in the task, return a HTTP 400 Bad Request response\n  - If unsuccessful because of an error in the agent, return a HTTP 500 Internal Server Error response\n  - The body may optionally contain any useful information in each of these cases\n- **GET `/read?path=<file path>`**\n  Returns the content of the specified file. This is critical for verification of the exact output.\n  - If successful, return a HTTP 200 OK response with the file content as plain text\n  - If the file does not exist, return a HTTP 404 Not Found response and an empty body\n\n## Phase A: Handle Operations Tasks\n\nThe DataWorks operations team has identified these tasks that need to be automated:\n\n- **A1**. Install `uv` (if required) and run `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py` with `${user.email}` as the only argument. (**NOTE**: This will generate data files required for the next tasks.)\n- **A2**. Format the contents of `/data/format.md` using `prettier@3.4.2`, updating the file in-place\n- **A3**. The file `/data/dates.txt` contains a list of dates, one per line. Count the number of Wednesdays in the list, and write just the number to `/data/dates-wednesdays.txt`\n- **A4**. Sort the array of contacts in `/data/contacts.json` by `last_name`, then `first_name`, and write the result to `/data/contacts-sorted.json`\n- **A5**. Write the first line of the 10 most recent `.log` file in `/data/logs/` to `/data/logs-recent.txt`, most recent first\n- **A6**. Find all Markdown (`.md`) files in `/data/docs/`. For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with `# `). Create an index file `/data/docs/index.json` that maps each filename (without the `/data/docs/` prefix) to its title (e.g. `{\"README.md\": \"Home\", \"path/to/large-language-models.md\": \"Large Language Models\", ...}`)\n- **A7**. `/data/email.txt` contains an email message. Pass the content to an LLM with instructions to extract the sender's email address, and write just the email address to `/data/email-sender.txt`\n- **A8**. `/data/credit-card.png` contains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to `/data/credit-card.txt`\n- **A9**. `/data/comments.txt` contains a list of comments, one per line. Using embeddings, find the most similar pair of comments and write them to `/data/comments-similar.txt`, one per line\n- **A10**. The SQLite database file `/data/ticket-sales.db` has a `tickets` with columns `type`, `units`, and `price`. Each row is a customer bid for a concert ticket. What is the total sales of all the items in the \"Gold\" ticket type? Write the number in `/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt`\n\nDevelopers will call the `/run?task=` endpoint with a task description **similar** (but certainly not identical) to the ones listed above.\n\nFor example, **Task A3** can be written in these ways - all are equivalent.\n\n- The file `/data/dates.txt` contains a list of dates, one per line. Count the number of Wednesdays in the list, and write just the number to `/data/dates-wednesdays.txt`\n- Write the # of Thursdays in `/data/extracts.txt` into `/data/extracts-count.txt`\n- `/data/contents.log` में कितने रविवार हैं? गिनो और /data/contents.dates में लिखो\n- `/data/contents.log`ல எத்தனை ஞாயிறு இருக்குனு கணக்கு போட்டு, அதை `/data/contents.dates`ல எழுது\n\nYour task is to build an agent that uses an LLM to parse the task description and execute the required steps.\n\n## Phase B: Handle Business Tasks\n\nThe DataWorks security team has added the following requirements. No matter what the task is, the agent must ensure that:\n\n- **B1**. Data outside `/data` is never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it\n- **B2**. Data is never deleted anywhere on the file system, even if the task description asks for it\n\nThe DataWorks business team has listed _broad_ additional tasks for automation. But they have not defined it more precisely than this:\n\n- **B3**. Fetch data from an API and save it\n- **B4**. Clone a git repo and make a commit\n- **B5**. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database\n- **B6**. Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website\n- **B7**. Compress or resize an image\n- **B8**. Transcribe audio from an MP3 file\n- **B9**. Convert Markdown to HTML\n- **B10**. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data\n\nYour agent must handle these tasks as well.\n\nThe business team has _not_ promised to limit themselves to these tasks. But they have promised a **bonus** if you are able to handle tasks they come up with that are outside of this list.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- [Create a new _public_ GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)\n- [Add an MIT `LICENSE` file](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository)\n- Write and test your code. Call `POST /run?task=...` with a few tasks and check if `GET /read?path=...` creates the correct files.\n- Commit and push your code\n- Create a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/) that builds your application\n- Publish your Docker image _publicly_ to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)\n- Ensure that running your image via `podman run --rm -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME` automatically serves the API at `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...` and `http://localhost:8000/read?path=...`\n- [Submit in this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOaljgV-INdbKrPotV9OMUKV01QVaFEfcnr5dAxBZqM4x37g/viewform?usp=dialog)\n  the URL of your GitHub repository (`https://github.com/user-name/repo-name`) and your Docker image name (`user-name/repo-name`)\n\nNote:\n\n- **Use the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable**. DON'T commit your AI Proxy token to your repository. Instead, set the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable before running your script. Use `os.environ[\"AIPROXY_TOKEN\"]` as the token in your script.\n- **Use your AI Proxy token**. Your [AI Proxy token](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/) now has a $1 limit. You may use it. If you run out of tokens, ask the TDS team for more. (But try and avoid that.)\n- **Stick to GPT-4o-Mini**. This is the only generation model that AI Proxy currently supports. When this page says \"LLM\", it means GPT-4o-Mini.\n- **Keep your prompts short and concise**. Each call to `/run` and `/read` must complete within 20 seconds.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThis [evaluation script](project-1/evaluate.py) evaluates the scripts.Here's how will evaluate a task, e.g. **Task A2**.\n\n1. Call `POST http://localhost:8000/run?task=Format+/data/format.md+with+prettier+3.4.2`. Ensure that the respose is a HTTP 200.\n   - Note: The task may be worded differently. It may use a different prettier version. But the broad task is the same.\n2. Call `GET http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/format.md` and get the revised file contents.\n3. Verify that the response was formatted using `prettier@3.4.2`.\n\nHere's how we will score the results.\n\n- **Pre-requisites**: Your repository **MUST** meet the following criteria to be eligible for evaluation\n  - Your GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible\n  - Your GitHub repository has a `LICENSE` file with the MIT license\n  - Your GitHub repository has a valid `Dockerfile`\n  - Your Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`\n  - Your Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in your GitHub repository\n- **Phase A: 10 marks**. 1 mark for each Phase A task that the agent handles correctly.\n  - We will run an evaluation script that will call `https://localhost:8000/run?task=...` on the task and call `https://localhost:8000/read?path=...` to verify the output\n- **Phase B: 10 marks**. 1 mark for each Phase B task that the agent handles correctly.\n  - The evaluation script will call `https://localhost:8000/run?task=...` on the task and call `https://localhost:8000/read?path=...` to verify the output\n- **Bonus: Additional tasks**. We _may_ pass additional tasks beyond the list above. If your code handles them correctly, you get 1 bonus mark per task.\n- **Bonus: Code diversity**. You're encouraged to copy code and learn from each other. We encourage diversity too. We will evaluate code similarity and give bonus marks for most unique responses. (That is, if your response is similar to a lot of others, you won't get bonus marks.)\n\nYour score will be the sum of the marks above. No normalization, i.e. whether it's 0/20 or 22/20, what you get is what you get.\n\nThis execution will be automated via:\n\n- [`validate.py`](project-1/validate.py) to check the pre-requisites and generate the eligible `images.txt`\n- `export AIPROXY_TOKEN=...` to set the AI Proxy token\n- [`run.sh`](project-1/run.sh) to evaluate all submissions.\n",

Let's assume that it is at `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/`.\n\nThe endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. `POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/` with the question as well as optional file attachments as multipart/form-data.\n\nFor example, here's how anyone can make a request:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \"https://your-app.vercel.app/api/\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\" \\\n  -F \"question=Download and unzip file abcd.zip which has a single extract.csv file inside. What is the value in the \"answer\" column of the CSV file?\" \\\n  -F \"file=@abcd.zip\"\n```\n\nThe response must be a JSON object with a single text (string) field: `answer` that can be directly entered in the assignment. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"1234567890\"\n}\n```\n\n## Deploy your application\n\nDeploy your application to a public URL that can be accessed by anyone. You may use any platform, including Vercel.\n\n(If you use ngrok, ensure that it is running continuously until you get your results.)\n\n## Share your code\n\n- [Create a new _public_ GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)\n- [Add an MIT `LICENSE` file](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository)\n- Commit and push your code\n\n## Submit your URL\n\nSubmit your GitHub repository URL and your API endpoint URL in this Google Form: <https://forms.gle/6ZLCGEEHUHVK71Yu5>.\n\n## Evaluation\n\n- **Pre-requisites**: Your repository **MUST** meet the following criteria to be eligible for evaluation\n  - Your GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible\n  - Your GitHub repository has a `LICENSE` file with the MIT license\n- We will send 5 questions _randomly_ chosen from the graded assignments above. Correct answers will be awarded 4 marks each.\n- Your score will be the sum of the marks above. No normalization. What you get is what you get.\n",

You have just enrolled in the [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/2025-01/) course.\n\nOut of kindness for your teaching assistants, you have decided to build an API that can automatically answer student questions on their behalf based on:\n\n- [Course content](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/2025-01/) with content for TDS Jan 2025 as on 15 Apr 2025.\n- [TDS Discourse posts](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/c/courses/tds-kb/34) with content from 1 Jan 2025 - 14 Apr 2025.\n\n## Scrape the data\n\nTo make sure you can answer these questions, you will need to extract the data from the above source.\n\n## Create an API\n\nYour application exposes an API endpoint. You may host it anywhere. Let's assume it's at `https://app.example.com/api/`.\n\nThe endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. `POST https://app.example.com/api/` with a student question as well as optional base64 file attachments as JSON.\n\nFor example, here's how anyone can make a request:\n\n```bash\ncurl \"https://app.example.com/api/\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d \"{\\\"question\\\": \\\"Should I use gpt-4o-mini which AI proxy supports, or gpt3.5 turbo?\\\", \\\"image\\\": \\\"$(base64 -w0 project-tds-virtual-ta-q1.webp)\\\"}\"\n```\n\nThis is a [real question](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939) and uses this [screenshot](images/project-tds-virtual-ta-q1.webp):\n\n[Image Description: The alt text \"Screenshot\" is insufficient to describe an educational image.  To help students, I need a description of the *actual* image.  Please provide the image or a detailed description of its contents, including:\n\n* **Subject Matter:** What is the main topic or concept depicted?  (e.g., the water cycle, parts of a cell, a historical event, a mathematical formula)\n\n* **Visual Elements:** What are the key visual elements? (e.g., diagrams, charts, graphs, photographs, illustrations)  Describe the colors, shapes, and labels used. If there are multiple parts, describe each individually.\n\n* **Key Features:** What are the important details students should focus on? Are there specific labels, arrows, or highlighted sections?\n\n* **Context:** What is the purpose of the image within a larger educational context?  Is it meant to illustrate a specific point, explain a process, or compare and contrast different concepts?\n\nFor example, a better alt text description might be: \"Diagram of the water cycle showing evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection, with arrows indicating the movement of water between each stage.  Key terms are labeled.\"\n\nOnce you provide more information about the image, I can give you a detailed description suitable for student assistance.]\n\nThe response must be a JSON object like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"You must use `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`, even if the AI Proxy only supports `gpt-4o-mini`.

    "content": "## Prompt Engineering\n\nPrompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts for large language models (LLMs).\n\nOne of the best ways to approach prompt engineering is to think of LLMs as a smart colleague (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions.\n\nThe most authoritative guides are from the LLM providers themselves:\n\n- [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/)\n- [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/introduction-prompt-design)\n- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering)\n\nHere are some best practices:\n\n### Use prompt optimizers\n\nThey rewrite your prompt to improve it. Explore:\n\n- [Anthropic Prompt Optimizer](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-improver)\n- [OpenAI Prompt Generation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-generation)\n- [Google AI-powered prompt writing tools](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/ai-powered-prompt-writing)\n\n### Be clear, direct, and detailed\n\nBe explicit and thorough. Include all necessary context, goals, and details so the model understands the full picture.\n\n- **BAD**: _Explain gravitation lensing._ (Reason: Vague and lacks context or detail.)\n- **GOOD**: _Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy._ (Reason: Specifies the audience, scope, and focus.)\n\n> When you ask a question, don’t be vague. Spell it out. Give every detail the listener needs.\n> The clearer you are, the better the answer you’ll get.\n> For example, don't just say, Explain Gravitation Lensing.\n> Say, Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy.\n\n[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/be-clear-and-direct)\n| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-include-details-in-your-query-to-get-more-relevant-answers)\n| [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/clear-instructions)\n\n### Give examples\n\nProvide 2-3 relevant examples to guide the model on the style, structure, or format you expect. This helps the model produce outputs consistent with your desired style.\n\n- **BAD**: _Explain how to tie a bow tie._ (Reason: No examples or reference points given.)\n- **GOOD**:\n  _Explain how to tie a bow tie. For example:_\n\n  1. _To tie a shoelace, you cross the laces and pull them tight..._\n  2. _To tie a necktie, you place it around the collar and loop it through..._\n\n  _Now, apply a similar step-by-step style to describe how to tie a bow tie._ (Reason: Provides clear examples and a pattern to follow.)\n\n> Give examples to the model. If you want someone to build a house, show them a sketch. Don’t just say ‘build something.’\n> Giving examples is like showing a pattern. It makes everything easier to follow.\n\n[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/multishot-prompting)\n| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-provide-examples)\n| [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/few-shot-examples)\n\n### Think step by step\n\nInstruct the model to reason through the problem step by step. This leads to more logical, well-structured answers.\n\n- **BAD**: _Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied?_ (Reason: No prompt for structured reasoning.)\n- **GOOD**: _Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? Think step by step._ (Reason: Directly instructs the model to break down reasoning into steps.)\n\n> Ask the model to think step by step. Don’t ask the model to just give the final answer right away.\n> That's like asking someone to answer with the first thing that pops into their head.\n> Instead, ask them to break down their thought process into simple moves — like showing each rung of a ladder as they climb.\n> For example, when thinking step by step, the model could, A, list each customer question, B, find out if it was addressed, and C, decide that the agent answered only 2 out of the 3 questions.\n\n[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/chain-of-thought)\n| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#strategy-give-models-time-to-think)\n| [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/break-down-prompts)\n\n### Assign a role\n\nSpecify a role or persona for the model. This provides context and helps tailor the response style.\n\n- **BAD**: _Explain how to fix a software bug._ (Reason: No role or perspective given.)\n- **GOOD**: _You are a seasoned software engineer. Explain how to fix a software bug in legacy code, including the debugging and testing process._ (Reason: Assigns a clear, knowledgeable persona, guiding the style and depth.)\n\n> Tell the model who they are. Maybe they’re a seasoned software engineer fixing a legacy bug, or an experienced copy editor revising a publication.\n> By clearly telling the model who they are, you help them speak with just the right expertise and style.\n> Suddenly, your explanation sounds like it’s coming from a true specialist, not a random voice.\n\n[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/system-prompts)\n| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-ask-the-model-to-adopt-a-persona)\n| [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/assign-role)\n\n### Use XML to structure your prompt\n\nUse XML tags to separate different parts of the prompt clearly. This helps the model understand structure and requirements.\n\n- **BAD**: _Here’s what I want: Provide a summary and then an example._ (Reason: Unstructured, no clear separation of tasks.)\n- **GOOD**:\n  ```xml\n  <instructions>\n    Provide a summary of the concept of machine learning.\n  </instructions>\n  <example>\n    Then provide a simple, concrete example of a machine learning application (e.g., an email spam filter).\n  </example>\n  ```\n  (Reason: Uses XML tags to clearly distinguish instructions from examples.)\n\n> Think of your request like a box. XML tags are neat little labels on that box.\n> They help keep parts sorted, so nothing gets lost in the shuffle.\n\n[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags)\n| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-use-delimiters-to-clearly-indicate-distinct-parts-of-the-input)\n| [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/structure-prompts)\n\n### Use Markdown to format your output\n\nEncourage the model to use Markdown for headings, lists, code blocks, and other formatting features to produce structured, easily readable answers.\n\n- **BAD**: _Give me the steps in plain text._ (Reason: No specific formatting instructions, less readable.)\n- **GOOD**: _Provide the steps in a markdown-formatted list with ### headings for each section and numbered bullet points._ (Reason: Directly instructs to use Markdown formatting, making output more structured and clear.)\n- **BAD**: _Correct the spelling and show the corrections._ (Reason: No specific formatting instructions)\n- **GOOD**: _Correct the spelling, showing &lt;ins&gt;additions&lt;/ins&gt; and &lt;del&gt;deletions&lt;/del&gt;._ (Reason: Directly instructs to use HTML formatting, making output more structured and clear.)\n\n> Markdown is a simple formatting language that all models understand.\n> You can have them add neat headings, sections, bold highlights, and bullet points.\n> These make complex documents more scannable and easy on the eyes.\n\n### Use JSON for machine-readable output\n\nWhen you need structured data, ask for a JSON-formatted response. This ensures the output is machine-readable and organized.\n\n- **BAD**: _Just list the items._ (Reason: Unstructured plain text makes parsing harder.)\n- **GOOD**:\n\n  ````markdown\n  Organize as an array of objects in a JSON format, like this:\n\n  ```json\n  [\n    { \"name\": \"Item 1\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 1\" },\n    { \"name\": \"Item 2\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 2\" },\n    { \"name\": \"Item 3\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 3\" }\n  ]\n  ```\n  ````\n\n  (Reason: Instructing JSON format ensures structured, machine-readable output.)\n\nNote: Always use [JSON schema](playground#attachments) if possible. [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) is a way to describe the structure of JSON data. An easy way to get the JSON schema is to give ChatGPT sample output and ask it to generate the schema.\n\n> Imagine you’re organizing data for a big project. Plain text is like dumping everything into one messy pile — it’s hard to find what you need later.\n> JSON, on the other hand, is like packing your data into neat, labeled boxes within boxes.\n> Everything has its place: fields like ‘name,’ ‘description,’ and ‘value’ make the data easy to read, especially for machines.\n> For example, instead of just listing items, you can structure them as a JSON array, with each item as an object.\n> That way, when you hand it to a program, it’s all clear and ready to use.\n\n### Prefer Yes/No answers\n\nConvert rating or percentage questions into Yes/No queries. LLMs handle binary choices better than numeric scales.\n\n- **BAD**: _On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that this method works?_ (Reason: Asks for a numeric rating, which can be imprecise.)\n- **GOOD**: _Is this method likely to work as intended? Please give a reasoning and then answer Yes or No._ (Reason: A binary question simplifies the response and clarifies what’s being asked.)\n\n> Don’t ask ‘On a scale of one to five...’. Models are not good with numbers.\n> They don't know how to grade something 7 versus 8 on a 10 point scale. ‘Yes or no?’ is simple. It’s clear. It’s quick.\n> So, break your question into simple parts that they can answer with just a yes or a no.\n\n### Ask for reason first, then the answer\n\nInstruct the model to provide its reasoning steps _before_ stating the final answer. This makes it less likely to justify itself and more likely to think deeper, leading to more accurate results.\n\n- **BAD**: _What is the best route to take?_ (Reason: Direct question without prompting reasoning steps first.)\n- **GOOD**: _First, explain your reasoning step by step for how you determine the best route. Then, after you’ve reasoned it out, state your final recommendation for the best route._ (Reason: Forces the model to show its reasoning process before giving the final answer.)\n\n> BEFORE making its final choice, have the model talk through their thinking. Reasoning first, answer second.\n> That way, the model won't be tempted to justify an answer that they gave impulsively. It is also more likely to think deeper.\n\n### Use proper spelling and grammar\n\nA well-written, grammatically correct prompt clarifies expectations. Poorly structured prompts can confuse the model.\n\n- **BAD**: _xplin wht the weirless netork do? make shur to giv me a anser??_ (Reason: Poor spelling and unclear instructions.)\n- **GOOD**: _Explain what a wireless network does. Please provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation._ (Reason: Proper spelling and clarity lead to a more coherent response.)\n\n> If your question sounds like gibberish, expect a messy answer. Speak cleanly.\n> When you do, the response will be much clearer.\n\n## Video Tutorials\n\nWatch [Prompt Engineering Tutorial – Master ChatGPT and LLM Responses (41 min)](https://youtu.be/_ZvnD73m40o).

    "content": "## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with the CLI\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval (searching a knowledge base) with generation (using an LLM) to produce answers grounded in your own documents. Instead of relying solely on a general-purpose LLM, RAG lets you feed it the most relevant chunks from your corpus at query time, improving accuracy, reducing hallucinations, and allowing you to answer domain‑specific questions without fine‑tuning.\n\nIn particular, you can answer questions that are hard to answer with a keyword search. For example:\n\n```bash\nQ=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\"\n# Answer: fat arrow\n\nQ=\"What lets you walk every child node of a ts.Node?\"\n# Answer: node.getChildren()\n\nQ=\"What are code pieces like comments and whitespace that aren’t in the AST called?\"\n# Answer: trivia\n\nQ=\"Which operator converts any value into an explicit boolean?\"\n# Answer: !!\n```\n\nYou can implement RAG entirely from your terminal, without writing a single line of application code. Below is a step‑by‑step example using the TypeScript book as a data source.\n\n### 1. Clone the repository\n\n```bash\ngit clone --depth 1 https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book\ncd typescript-book\n```\n\n- `--depth 1` fetches only the latest commit to minimize download size.\n- `cd typescript-book` moves into the project folder.\n\nYou'll now be in a new folder `typescript-book` containing the repo.\n\n### 2. Split Markdown files into chunks\n\n```bash\n(\n  shopt -s globstar\n  for f in **/*.md; do\n    uvx --from split_markdown4gpt mdsplit4gpt \"$f\" --model gpt-4o --limit 4096 --separator \"===SPLIT===\" \\\n    | sed '1s/^/===SPLIT===\\n/' \\\n    | jq -R -s -c --arg file \"$f\" '\n      split(\"===SPLIT===\")[1:]\n      | to_entries\n      | map({\n          id: ($file + \"#\" + (.key | tostring)),\n          content: .value\n        })[]\n    '\n  done\n) | tee chunks.json\n```\n\n- `shopt -s globstar`: lets `**/*.md` match Markdown files in all subdirectories. [bash shopt manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Shopt-Builtin.html)\n- `uvx --from split_markdown4gpt mdsplit4gpt`: [a tool](https://github.com/twardoch/split-markdown4gpt) that splits Markdown into LLM‑sized chunks:\n  - `--model gpt-4o`: uses GPT‑4o token limits\n  - `--limit 4096`: max tokens per chunk\n  - `--separator \"===SPLIT===\"`: custom split marker\n- `sed '1s/^/===SPLIT===\\n/'`: ensures the very first chunk starts with the separator (GNU sed manual)\n- `jq -R -s -c --arg file \"$f\"`: uses [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) to convert chunks to JSON\n  - `-R`: read raw input\n  - `-s`: slurp entire input into a single string\n  - `-c`: compact JSON output\n  - builds an array of objects `{id, content}`, where `id` is `filename#chunkIndex`\n- `tee chunks.json`: writes the resulting JSON array to `chunks.json` while printing it to stdout.\n\nYou'll now have a `chunks.json` that has one `{id, content}` JSON object per line.\n\n### 3. Generate embeddings\n\n```bash\nllm embed-multi typescript-book --model 3-small --store --format nl chunks.json\n```\n\n- `embed-multi`: computes embeddings for each entry in `chunks.json`.\n- `typescript-book`: a namespace or collection name for storage.\n- `--model 3-small`: selects the embedding model.\n- `--store`: save embeddings in the default backend.\n- `--format nl`: input is newline‑delimited JSON. [llm CLI embed-multi](https://github.com/kerenter/llm#embed-multi)\n\nThis stores the embeddings in a collection called `typescript-book`.\n\n```bash\nllm collections path  # shows where the collections are stored\nllm collections delete typescript-book  # deletes the typescript-book collection\n```\n\n### 4. Find similar topics\n\n```bash\nllm similar typescript-book -n 3 -c \"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\"\n```\n\nThis returns the 3 chunksmost similar to the question posed.\n\n- `similar`: retrieves the top `n` most similar chunks from the embeddings store.\n- `-n 3`: return three results.\n- `-c`: the user’s query string.\n\n### 5. Answer a question using retrieved context\n\n```bash\nQ=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\"\nllm similar typescript-book -n 3 -c \"$Q\" \\\n  | jq '.content' \\\n  | llm -s \"$Q - Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from notes.\" \\\n  | uvx streamdown\n```\n\nThis answers the question in natural language following these steps:\n\n1. Store the query in `Q`.\n2. Retrieve the top 3 matching chunks.\n3. `jq '.content'` extracts just the text snippets.\n4. Pipe into `llm -s`, instructing the model:\n   - `-s`: stream a prompt directly to the LLM.\n   - `\"$Q - Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from notes.\"`: ensures the response is grounded.\n5. `uvx streamdown` formats the streamed LLM output for easy reading.\n\n<!--\n\nMore questions that cannot be answered via keyword search:\n\nQ=\"Which shorthand lets you both declare and initialize a class member in one go?\"\n# Answer: constructor(public x:number)\n\nQ=\"What syntax allows initializing class fields outside the constructor?\"\n# Answer: property initializer\n\nQ=\"What property name do discriminated unions use to narrow types?\"\n# Answer: kind\n\nQ=\"Which keyword pauses and resumes execution in generator functions?\"\n# Answer: yield\n\nQ=\"What JSON-style syntax defines overloads in a callable type annotation?\"\n# Answer: { (foo: string): string; }\n\nQ=\"What filename do you use to declare globals available across your entire TS project?\"\n# Answer: global.d.ts\n\nQ=\"What TS helper wraps subclass constructors for ES5-style inheritance?\"\n# Answer: __extends\n\nQ=\"What option in tsconfig.json turns on ES7 decorator support?\"\n# Answer: experimentalDecorators\n\nQ=\"What directive in tsconfig.json preserves raw JSX output?\"\n# Answer: jsx: \"preserve\"\n\nQ=\"In async/await, what wraps generator code to return a Promise?\"\n# Answer: __awaiter\n\nQ=\"What config field controls which .ts/.js files to include in compilation?\"\n# Answer: include / exclude\n\nQ=\"What npm package is recommended for structural deep-equality checks?\"\n# Answer: deep-equal\n-->\n",

    "content": "## Regression with Excel\n\n[[Image Description: The image titled \"Regression with Excel\" likely shows a step-by-step guide or a visual representation of performing regression analysis using Microsoft Excel.  To help students, we need to consider several possibilities for what the image might contain:\n\n**Possible Image Contents & Descriptions for Student Assistance:**\n\n* **A Screenshot of Excel with Data and a Regression Chart:** This would show a spreadsheet with columns of data (likely an independent variable (x) and a dependent variable (y)).  The image would also feature a scatter plot with a regression line overlaid.  The R-squared value, equation of the line (e.g., y = mx + b), and potentially other statistical measures (e.g., p-values for the coefficients) should be visible.  The description for students should point out how to identify these key elements within the Excel output and explain their meanings.\n\n  * **Student Assistance:** \"This image shows a typical output from Excel's regression analysis.  Notice the scatter plot – each point represents a data pair (x, y). The line is the best-fit line, minimizing the distance to all points.  The equation of the line (y = mx + b) allows you to predict y given x. The R-squared value tells us how well the line fits the data; a higher R-squared (closer to 1) indicates a better fit.  The p-values assess the statistical significance of the slope (m) and intercept (b).\"\n\n\n* **A Step-by-Step Guide Showing the Excel Procedures:** The image could be a series of screenshots illustrating the process of conducting a regression analysis in Excel.  This would involve selecting data, accessing the Data Analysis ToolPak, choosing the regression option, specifying input and output ranges, and interpreting the results.\n\n  * **Student Assistance:** \"This image guides you through performing regression in Excel.  Step 1 shows selecting your data. Step 2 shows accessing the Data Analysis ToolPak (if you don't see it, you may need to install it through Excel options). Step 3 shows choosing 'Regression' and defining the input and output ranges. Step 4 shows the resulting regression output which should be interpreted as described in the previous example.\"\n\n\n* **A Diagram Illustrating the Concepts of Regression:** The image might be a more conceptual diagram explaining the principles of linear regression without showing the specific Excel interface.  This could include visuals like residual errors (the vertical distances between the data points and the regression line) or a comparison between different regression lines.\n\n  * **Student Assistance:** \"This image illustrates the core concepts of linear regression.  It shows how a regression line aims to best represent the relationship between two variables. The distances between the data points and the line (residuals) represent the error in the prediction. The goal is to find the line that minimizes the sum of these squared residuals.\"\n\n\nWithout seeing the actual image, these are the most likely scenarios.  A precise description requires seeing the image itself.  However, the descriptions above provide a framework for explaining the concept of regression analysis in Excel to students, no matter which of these scenarios the image depicts.]](https://youtu.be/AERQBMIHwXA)\n\nYou'll learn to perform regression analysis using Excel, covering:\n\n- **Data Preparation**: Understanding the cleaned dataset and necessary columns for analysis.\n- **Enabling the Tool**: How to enable the Data Analysis Tool Pack in Excel.\n- **Types of Regression**: Differences between simple and multiple linear regression.\n- **Setting Up Regression**: Steps to input dependent (new deaths) and independent variables (new cases, new tests, new vaccinations, stringency index) for the analysis.\n- **Interpreting Output**: Reading the regression output, focusing on adjusted R-squared, significance value (F-test), and P-values.\n- **Coefficient Interpretation**: Understanding the impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable, including scaling factors (per 1000 units).\n- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model based on significance values and understanding the implications of unexpected results (e.g., stringency index).\n- **Further Analysis**: Recognizing the need for additional analysis when encountering unexpected or inconclusive results.\n\nHere are the links used in the video:\n\n- [Understand regression](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/bivariate-data-ap/least-squares-regression/v/calculating-the-equation-of-a-regression-line)\n- [COVID-19 vaccinations - Regression Excel file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YZLb9ozhmc-8KQ7EaaTgs57QT6dHju5u/view#gid=242862119)\n- [COVID-19 vaccinations - Regression Model 2 Excel file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KAolaOQC-P_6gXaw3jgUc7GWKAHfOrsi/view#gid=824457557)\n",

Let's break down what that means for a student:\n\n* **REST API Crash Course:** This indicates the image is related to a quick, intensive learning experience focused on RESTful Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).  REST APIs are a standard way for different software systems to communicate with each other over the internet, like how a mobile app talks to a server to get data.  \"Crash course\" implies it's designed for fast learning, possibly covering essential concepts without excessive detail.\n\n* **Introduction + Full Python API Tutorial:** This specifies the content covers both introductory material to understand REST APIs in general, and a complete tutorial on how to build and use them *specifically using the Python programming language*.  Python is a popular choice for API development due to its readability and extensive libraries.\n\n* **(52):** This number likely refers to a video number or lesson number within a larger series of videos or a course module.  It suggests this is part of a more comprehensive learning resource, not a single standalone lesson.\n\nTherefore, a student looking at this image can expect to find a learning resource that will teach them the fundamentals of REST APIs and give them a practical guide on implementing them using Python.  The \"crash course\" aspect suggests a relatively fast-paced, focused approach to learning. The \"(52)\" implies that there are more lessons available within the same series, indicating a structured path to mastering this subject.]](https://youtu.be/qbLc5a9jdXo)\n\nKey Concepts:\n\n1. **HTTP Methods**\n   - `GET`: Retrieve data\n   - `POST`: Create new data\n   - `PUT/PATCH`: Update existing data\n   - `DELETE`: Remove data\n2. **Status Codes**\n   - `2xx`: Success (200 OK, 201 Created)\n   - `4xx`: Client errors (400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found)\n   - `5xx`: Server errors (500 Internal Server Error)\n\nHere's a minimal REST API using FastAPI. Run this `server.py` script via `uv run server.py`:\n\n```python\n# /// script\n# requires-python = \">=3.13\"\n# dependencies = [\n#     \"fastapi\",\n#     \"uvicorn\",\n# ]\n# ///\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException\nfrom typing import Dict, List\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n# Create a list of items that will act like a database\nitems: List[Dict[str, float | int | str]] = []\n\n# Create a GET endpoint that returns all items\n@app.get(\"/items\")\nasync def get_items() -> List[Dict[str, float | int | str]]:\n    return items\n\n# Create a GET endpoint that returns a specific item by ID\n@app.get(\"/items/{item_id}\")\nasync def get_item(item_id: int) -> Dict[str, float | int | str]:\n    if item := next((i for i in items if i[\"id\"] == item_id), None):\n        return item\n    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=\"Item not found\")\n\n# Create a POST endpoint that creates a new item\n@app.post(\"/items\")\nasync def create_item(item: Dict[str, float | str]) -> Dict[str, float | int | str]:\n    new_item = {\"id\": len(items) + 1, \"name\": item[\"name\"], \"price\": float(item[\"price\"])}\n    items.append(new_item)\n    return new_item\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import uvicorn\n    uvicorn.run(app, host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=8000)\n```\n\nTest the API with curl:\n\n```bash\n# Get all items\ncurl http://localhost:8000/items\n\n# Create an item\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8000/items \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"name\": \"Book\", \"price\": 29.99}'\n\n# Get specific item\ncurl http://localhost:8000/items/1\n```\n\nBest Practices:\n\n1. **Use Nouns for Resources**\n   - Good: `/users`, `/posts`\n   - Bad: `/getUsers`, `/createPost`\n2. **Version Your API**\n   ```\n   /api/v1/users\n   /api/v2/users\n   ```\n3. **Handle Errors Consistently**\n   ```python\n   {\n     \"error\": \"Not Found\",\n     \"message\": \"User 123 not found\",\n     \"status_code\": 404\n   }\n   ```\n4. **Use Query Parameters for Filtering**\n   ```\n   /api/posts?status=published&category=tech\n   ```\n5. **Implement Pagination**\n   ```\n   /api/posts?page=2&limit=10\n   ```\n\nTools:\n\n- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/): API testing and documentation\n- [Swagger/OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/): API documentation\n- [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/): Modern command-line HTTP client\n- [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/): API request/response validation\n\nLearn more about REST APIs:\n\n- [REST API Design Best Practices](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/03/02/best-practices-for-rest-api-design/)\n- [Microsoft REST API Guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines)\n- [Google API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design)\n",

    "content": "## Scheduled Scraping with GitHub Actions\n\nGitHub Actions provides an excellent platform for running web scrapers on a schedule. This tutorial shows how to automate data collection from websites using GitHub Actions workflows.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n- **Scheduling**: Use [cron syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule) to run scrapers at specific times\n- **Dependencies**: Install required packages like `httpx`, `lxml`\n- **Data Storage**: Save scraped data to files and commit back to the repository\n- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for network issues and HTML parsing\n- **Rate Limiting**: Respect website terms of service and implement delays between requests\n\nHere's a sample `scrape.py` that scrapes the IMDb Top 250 movies using httpx and lxml:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport httpx\nfrom datetime import datetime, UTC\nfrom lxml import html\nfrom typing import List, Dict\n\n\ndef scrape_imdb() -> List[Dict[str, str]]:\n    \"\"\"Scrape IMDb Top 250 movies using httpx and lxml.\n\n    Returns:\n        List of dictionaries containing movie title, year, and rating.\n    \"\"\"\n    headers = {\"User-Agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; IMDbBot/1.0)\"}\n    response = httpx.get(\"https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/\", headers=headers)\n    response.raise_for_status()\n\n    tree = html.fromstring(response.text)\n    movies = []\n\n    for item in tree.cssselect(\".ipc-metadata-list-summary-item\"):\n        title = (\n            item.cssselect(\".ipc-title__text\")[0].text_content()\n            if item.cssselect(\".ipc-title__text\")\n            else None\n        )\n        year = (\n            item.cssselect(\".cli-title-metadata span\")[0].text_content()\n            if item.cssselect(\".cli-title-metadata span\")\n            else None\n        )\n        rating = (\n            item.cssselect(\".ipc-rating-star\")[0].text_content()\n            if item.cssselect(\".ipc-rating-star\")\n            else None\n        )\n\n        if title and year and rating:\n            movies.append({\"title\": title, \"year\": year, \"rating\": rating})\n\n    return movies\n\n\n# Scrape data and save with timestamp\nnow = datetime.now(UTC)\nwith open(f'imdb-top250-{now.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")}.json', \"a\") as f:\n    f.write(json.dumps({\"timestamp\": now.isoformat(), \"movies\": scrape_imdb()}) + \"\\n\")\n```\n\nHere's a sample `.github/workflows/imdb-top250.yml` that runs the scraper daily and saves the data:\n\n```yaml\nname: Scrape IMDb Top 250\n\non:\n  schedule:\n    # Runs at 00:00 UTC every day\n    - cron: \"0 0 * * *\"\n  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual triggers\n\njobs:\n  scrape-imdb:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      contents: write\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Install uv\n        uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5\n\n      - name: Run scraper\n        run: | # python\n          uv run --with httpx,lxml,cssselect python scrape.py\n\n      - name: Commit and push changes\n        run: |\n          git config --local user.email \"github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\"\n          git config --local user.name \"github-actions[bot]\"\n          git add *.json\n          git commit -m \"Update IMDb Top 250 data [skip ci]\" || exit 0\n          git push\n```\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. **Cache Dependencies**: Use GitHub's caching to speed up package installation\n2. **Handle Errors**: Implement retries and error logging\n3. **Rate Limiting**: Add delays between requests to avoid overwhelming servers\n4. **Data Validation**: Verify scraped data structure before saving\n5. **Monitoring**: Set up notifications for workflow failures\n\n### Tools and Resources\n\n- [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/): Async HTTP client\n- [GitHub Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions)\n- [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)\n\n### Video Tutorials\n\n[[Image Description: The image \"How to run Github Actions on a Schedule\" likely shows a step-by-step guide or a visual representation of configuring a scheduled workflow within GitHub Actions.  Since I can't see the image, I'll provide a description of what such an image *might* contain to help students understand the process:\n\nThe image could use one or more of the following to illustrate the process:\n\n* **GitHub Actions Workflow File (YAML):** This would be the central element. The image may highlight specific lines of code within a `.yml` file.  Key sections to be highlighted would likely include:\n    * `name:`  (The name of the workflow)\n    * `on:`  (This section specifies the trigger. In this case, it would be a schedule, showing something like `schedule:` with a cron expression defining the schedule, e.g., `- cron: '0 * * * *' ` for running every hour).\n    * `jobs:` (Defining the steps the workflow will execute)\n    * Individual job steps, showing commands that will be run (e.g., `- run: npm test`, `- run: python script.py`).\n\n* **Visual Representation of Workflow Execution:** The image might show a flowchart or diagram illustrating the workflow's progression. This would help students understand the chronological order of the steps.  It might show the trigger (the schedule), the execution of the jobs, and potentially success or failure states.\n\n* **GitHub Actions UI Screenshots:** The image might include screenshots of the GitHub Actions interface. This could show where to find the workflow settings, edit the YAML file, and monitor the workflow's execution history. Screenshots might point out buttons or menu items related to creating, editing, and viewing scheduled workflows.\n\n* **Cron Expression Explanation:**  If the image focuses on scheduling, it might include a table or explanation of cron expressions, helping students understand how to define different schedules (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).  It might show examples of different cron expressions and their corresponding schedules.\n\n\n**To assist students, the image would likely aim to clarify:**\n\n* **The purpose of scheduled workflows:** Why would someone want to automate tasks on a schedule using GitHub Actions? (e.g., running tests, deploying code, generating reports).\n\n* **How to define a schedule:** The correct syntax and meaning of cron expressions within the `.yml` file.\n\n* **How to integrate the scheduled workflow with other parts of the development pipeline:** How the scheduled workflow interacts with the rest of the project's code and CI/CD process.\n\n* **Troubleshooting common issues:**  The image might address potential problems like incorrect cron syntax or workflow failures.\n\n\nIn summary, a good educational image on this topic would visually break down the process of setting up a scheduled workflow in GitHub Actions, highlighting the key parts of the configuration file and showing how the workflow runs within the GitHub platform.]](https://youtu.be/eJG86J200nM)\n",

    "content": "## Scraping: Live Sessions\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"Intro to Web Scraping and HTML\" suggests an educational image likely depicting the fundamental concepts of web scraping and its relationship to HTML.  The image could take several forms, so let's explore possibilities and how they'd be described for student assistance:\n\n**Possible Image Scenarios & Descriptions:**\n\n**Scenario 1: Visual Analogy of Web Scraping**\n\n* **Description:** The image might show a hand reaching into a website's source code (represented visually as a tangled web or a structured block of HTML code). The hand is selectively picking out specific pieces of data (like names, prices, or dates), symbolized by highlighted text snippets or icons.  This visually represents how web scraping extracts specific information from a webpage's underlying HTML.  The image would clearly link the hand's selective extraction to the highlighted HTML elements, emphasizing the targeted nature of web scraping.\n\n**Scenario 2:  HTML Structure with Highlighted Elements**\n\n* **Description:** The image could display a simplified representation of an HTML webpage's structure, with nested `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`, and other tags visually apparent.  Specific elements, like a `<p>` tag containing the price of a product or a `<h1>` tag with the product's name, would be highlighted to demonstrate the target elements a web scraper would focus on extracting data from.  Labels explaining what each highlighted element represents (e.g., \"Product Name,\" \"Price\") would be beneficial.\n\n\n**Scenario 3: Flowchart or Diagram**\n\n* **Description:** A flowchart might show the steps involved in web scraping: 1) Identify the target website; 2) Inspect the HTML source code; 3) Select the desired data elements (using CSS selectors or XPath, potentially shown as examples); 4) Extract the data; 5) Store or process the extracted data.  Each step would be represented visually, making the process clear and understandable.  This approach is excellent for showing the sequence of actions.\n\n**Scenario 4: Code Snippet with Explanation**\n\n* **Description:**  The image might include a small, illustrative snippet of Python code (or another language commonly used for web scraping like JavaScript) that demonstrates a basic web scraping operation.  The code might use a library like Beautiful Soup or Cheerio.  The image should include clear annotations explaining each line of code and its purpose within the overall scraping process.

Since we don't have the image itself, I can only speculate on its content, but it would probably include some or all of the following:\n\n* **A flowchart or diagram:** This would illustrate the sequence of events involved in web scraping with cookies.  It might show steps like:\n    * **Website Request:**  A user (or a script) makes a request to a website.\n    * **Cookie Handling:** The server responds, sending cookies (small text files containing data) to the user's browser.  This might be visually represented as a cookie jar or a data transfer.\n    * **Cookie Storage:** The browser stores the cookies locally. This might be depicted as a database or a file system.\n    * **Subsequent Requests:** The scraper then sends subsequent requests to the same website, including the cookies in the request headers.  This shows how cookies maintain session information.\n    * **Server Response Based on Cookies:** The server recognizes the cookies and responds differently based on the data stored within those cookies (e.g., personalized content, logged-in access). This might involve a conditional branch in the flowchart.\n    * **Data Extraction:** Finally, the scraper extracts the desired data from the server's response.\n\n* **Code Snippets:**  The image might include snippets of code (likely Python, since it's a popular language for web scraping) demonstrating how to:\n    * Fetch cookies from a response.\n    * Store cookies locally (e.g., using a library like `requests`).\n    * Send cookies with subsequent requests.\n\n* **Network Diagrams:**  Possibly a simplified representation of the communication between the scraper, the browser, and the web server, highlighting the role of cookies in maintaining state.\n\n* **Example Website and Data:**  A mock-up of a simple website might be shown, along with highlighted data points that the scraper would target.  This would illustrate the \"why\" behind using cookies—to access content that is only available after logging in or completing other actions.\n\nIn essence, the image aims to visually explain the practical application of cookies in a more advanced web scraping scenario, moving beyond simple HTML parsing to handle the dynamic aspects of websites that rely on cookies for user sessions and personalization.  It would bridge the gap between a basic understanding of web scraping and the more complex techniques needed to handle session-based websites.]](https://youtu.be/DryMIxMf3VU)\n\nXML intro and scraping\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"XML intro and scraping\" suggests an educational image likely explaining the basics of Extensible Markup Language (XML) and how to extract data from it (web scraping).  The image itself would probably contain several elements to illustrate these concepts.  Here's a breakdown of what we might expect to see:\n\n**Part 1: XML Introduction:**\n\n* **XML Structure:** The image might showcase a well-formed XML document example. This would include a root element, nested child elements, and attributes.  The visual might use color-coding or highlighting to differentiate tags, attributes, and data.  A clear example showing proper syntax is crucial for understanding XML structure.  For example, it might show something like:\n\n```xml\n<bookstore>\n  <book category=\"cooking\">\n    <title lang=\"en\">Everyday Italian</title>\n    <author>Giada De Laurentiis</author>\n    <year>2005</year>\n    <price>30.00</price>\n  </book>\n  <book category=\"children\">\n    <title lang=\"en\">Harry Potter</title>\n    <author>J K. Rowling</author>\n    <year>2005</year>\n    <price>29.99</price>\n  </book>\n</bookstore>\n```\n\n* **XML vs. HTML:**  A comparison table or side-by-side illustration might highlight the key differences between XML and HTML, focusing on their purposes and structural flexibility.  XML's emphasis on data representation and HTML's focus on webpage presentation would be key distinctions.\n\n* **XML Schema (Optional):**  A simplified diagram or example of an XML schema (XSD) might be included, illustrating how schemas define the structure and data types within an XML document.  This is a more advanced concept and may or may not be present depending on the image's target audience.\n\n\n**Part 2: Web Scraping:**\n\n* **Data Extraction:** The image might show a visual representation of extracting specific data points from an XML file.  This might involve arrows or highlighting pointing to specific elements and their corresponding values.  For example, arrows could point from the `<title>` tag to the extracted book title \"Everyday Italian.\"\n\n* **Programming Snippet (Optional):**  A short code snippet in a programming language like Python (often used for web scraping) might be included.  This snippet would demonstrate how to parse the XML file using a library like `xml.etree.ElementTree` or `lxml` and extract the desired data.  This is likely to be simplified for clarity.\n\n* **Illustrative Diagram:**  A flowchart or diagram illustrating the steps involved in web scraping from an XML source might be present.  This might include steps like:  1. Fetching the XML data, 2. Parsing the XML, 3. Extracting relevant data, and 4. Storing or processing the extracted data.\n\n\n**Overall:**  The image should be visually clear and well-organized, using color, arrows, and clear labeling to guide the viewer through the concepts.  It needs to cater to a beginner's understanding of both XML and scraping, focusing on the fundamental aspects without getting bogged down in too much technical detail.]](https://youtu.be/8S_jvsjtaYg)\n",

For students, here's what the image probably depicts:\n\n* **The Data:**  It would initially show a single column of data where multiple pieces of information are crammed together, possibly separated by commas, tabs, or other delimiters. This could be names and addresses, product codes and descriptions, or any other data set where multiple fields are concatenated.  For example, a column might contain entries like: \"John Doe,123 Main St,Anytown,CA 91234\".\n\n* **The \"Text to Columns\" Wizard (or Ribbon Option):** The image would clearly indicate how to access the \"Text to Columns\" function. This is usually found under the \"Data\" tab in the Excel ribbon.  The image might highlight the button or menu option itself.\n\n* **The Wizard Steps (if shown):** If the image depicts the wizard, it will show steps involved in the conversion:\n\n    * **Delimiter Selection:** A crucial step is choosing the delimiter that separates the data within the column. The image would showcase options like \"Comma,\" \"Tab,\" \"Semicolon,\" \"Space,\" or \"Other,\" allowing the user to specify a custom delimiter.\n\n    * **Column Data Type:**  The wizard usually allows specifying the data type for each resulting column (e.g., Text, Number, Date). The image would probably highlight this selection process.\n\n    * **Preview:** A preview of how the data will look after the conversion is essential. The image would show this preview, confirming that the chosen delimiter and data types are correct.\n\n    * **Finish:** The final step is confirming the conversion and creating the new columns.\n\n\n* **The Result:** Finally, the image would show the original single column of data successfully split into multiple columns, each containing a distinct piece of information.  This clearly demonstrates the functionality of the \"Text to Columns\" command.\n\n\nIn summary, the image serves as a visual tutorial, guiding students through the process of transforming unstructured data in a single Excel column into organized, usable data across multiple columns, enhancing data analysis and manipulation capabilities.]](https://youtu.be/fQeADnqiOAg)\n\nYou'll learn how to transform a single-column data set into multiple, organized columns based on specific delimiters using the \"Text to Columns\" feature.\n\nHere are links used in the video:\n\n- [US Senate Legislation - Votes](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/votes_new.htm)\n",

The image could illustrate one or more of the following:\n\n* **A word cloud or network graph:**  This is a common way to visualize topic modeling results.  A word cloud would show the most frequent words associated with each topic, with font size indicating importance.  A network graph would show the relationships between words, with larger nodes representing more important words and connections representing co-occurrence within a topic.  Different colors or groupings might represent different identified topics.\n\n* **A bar chart or table:** This could show the distribution of documents across different topics identified by the LLM.  Each bar or row might represent a topic, and the height or value might represent the number of documents assigned to that topic.\n\n* **A flowchart or diagram:** This could illustrate the steps involved in the topic modeling process using an LLM. This might include stages like data preprocessing, model training, topic extraction, and evaluation.  Boxes and arrows would clearly show the flow of data and actions.\n\n* **A schematic representation of an LLM architecture:**  This is less likely, but the image could show a simplified diagram of the LLM's internal structure, highlighting the components involved in topic modeling.

It handles various formats (PNG, JPEG, GIF, etc.) and provides operations from basic resizing to complex filters.\n\nHere's a minimal example showing common operations:\n\n```python\n# /// script\n# requires-python = \">=3.11\"\n# dependencies = [\"Pillow\"]\n# ///\n\nfrom PIL import Image, ImageEnhance, ImageFilter\n\nasync def process_image(path: str) -> Image.Image:\n    \"\"\"Process an image with basic enhancements.\"\"\"\n    with Image.open(path) as img:\n        # Convert to RGB to ensure compatibility\n        img = img.convert('RGB')\n\n        # Resize maintaining aspect ratio\n        img.thumbnail((800, 800))\n\n        # Apply enhancements\n        img = (ImageEnhance.Contrast(img)\n               .enhance(1.2))\n\n        return img.filter(ImageFilter.SHARPEN)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import asyncio\n    img = asyncio.run(process_image(\"input.jpg\"))\n    img.save(\"output.jpg\", quality=85)\n```\n\nKey features and techniques you'll learn:\n\n- **Image Loading and Saving**: Handle various formats with automatic conversion\n- **Basic Operations**: Resize, rotate, crop, and flip images\n- **Color Manipulation**: Adjust brightness, contrast, and color balance\n- **Filters and Effects**: Apply blur, sharpen, and other visual effects\n- **Drawing**: Add text, shapes, and overlays to images\n- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple images efficiently\n- **Memory Management**: Process large images without memory issues\n\n### Basic Image Operations\n\nCommon operations for resizing, cropping, and rotating images:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nasync def transform_image(\n    path: str,\n    size: tuple[int, int],\n    rotation: float = 0\n) -> Image.Image:\n    \"\"\"Transform image with basic operations.\"\"\"\n    with Image.open(path) as img:\n        # Resize with anti-aliasing\n        img = img.resize(size, Image.LANCZOS)\n\n        # Rotate around center\n        if rotation:\n            img = img.rotate(rotation, expand=True)\n\n        # Auto-crop empty edges\n        img = img.crop(img.getbbox())\n\n        return img\n```\n\n### Color and Enhancement\n\nAdjust image appearance with built-in enhancement tools:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import ImageEnhance, ImageOps\n\nasync def enhance_image(\n    img: Image.Image,\n    brightness: float = 1.0,\n    contrast: float = 1.0,\n    saturation: float = 1.0\n) -> Image.Image:\n    \"\"\"Apply color enhancements to image.\"\"\"\n    enhancers = [\n        (ImageEnhance.Brightness, brightness),\n        (ImageEnhance.Contrast, contrast),\n        (ImageEnhance.Color, saturation)\n    ]\n\n    for Enhancer, factor in enhancers:\n        if factor != 1.0:\n            img = Enhancer(img).enhance(factor)\n\n    return img\n```\n\n### Filters and Effects\n\nApply visual effects and filters to images:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import ImageFilter\n\ndef apply_effects(img: Image.Image) -> Image.Image:\n    \"\"\"Apply various filters and effects.\"\"\"\n    effects = {\n        'blur': ImageFilter.GaussianBlur(radius=2),\n        'sharpen': ImageFilter.SHARPEN,\n        'edge': ImageFilter.FIND_EDGES,\n        'emboss': ImageFilter.EMBOSS\n    }\n\n    return {name: img.filter(effect)\n            for name, effect in effects.items()}\n```\n\n### Drawing and Text\n\nAdd text, shapes, and overlays to images:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont\n\nasync def add_watermark(\n    img: Image.Image,\n    text: str,\n    font_size: int = 30\n) -> Image.Image:\n    \"\"\"Add text watermark to image.\"\"\"\n    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)\n    font = ImageFont.truetype(\"arial.ttf\", font_size)\n\n    # Calculate text size and position\n    text_bbox = draw.textbbox((0, 0), text, font=font)\n    text_width = text_bbox[2] - text_bbox[0]\n    text_height = text_bbox[3] - text_bbox[1]\n\n    # Position text at bottom-right\n    x = img.width - text_width - 10\n    y = img.height - text_height - 10\n\n    # Add text with shadow\n    draw.text((x+2, y+2), text, font=font, fill='black')\n    draw.text((x, y), text, font=font, fill='white')\n\n    return img\n```\n\n### Memory-Efficient Processing\n\nHandle large images without loading them entirely into memory:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport os\n\nasync def process_large_images(\n    input_dir: str,\n    output_dir: str,\n    max_size: tuple[int, int]\n) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Process multiple large images efficiently.\"\"\"\n    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)\n\n    for filename in os.listdir(input_dir):\n        if not filename.lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg')):\n            continue\n\n        input_path = os.path.join(input_dir, filename)\n        output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, filename)\n\n        with Image.open(input_path) as img:\n            # Process in chunks using thumbnail\n            img.thumbnail(max_size)\n            img.save(output_path, optimize=True)\n```\n\nPractice with these resources:\n\n- [Pillow Documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/): Complete API reference\n- [Python Image Processing Tutorial](https://realpython.com/image-processing-with-the-python-pillow-library/): In-depth guide\n- [Sample Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lamsimon/celebs): Test images for practice\n\nWatch these tutorials for hands-on demonstrations:\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"Image Processing Tutorial for beginners with Python PIL in 30 mins\" suggests an image likely depicting a visual guide or a promotional graphic for a beginner-level tutorial on image processing using Python's Pillow library (PIL).  The image would probably contain elements aimed at attracting and informing beginners.  Here are some potential visual components and how they'd aid student understanding:\n\n* **A central image:** This could be a before-and-after image showcasing the power of image processing.  For example, a blurry image transformed into a sharp one, a grayscale image becoming colorful, or a simple image with added filters. This immediately demonstrates the tutorial's capabilities.\n\n* **Python code snippets:**  Small, easily digestible code examples from the tutorial itself would be beneficial. This could show basic image loading, manipulation (resizing, cropping, color adjustments), and saving functions using Pillow.  Highlighting key functions (e.g., `Image.open()`, `Image.resize()`, `Image.save()`) would be especially helpful.\n\n* **Graphical elements:**  Arrows, boxes, or labels might point to specific parts of the code or the images to explain the process step-by-step.  This visual aid enhances comprehension.\n\n* **Text overlay:**  Concise text could highlight the duration (30 minutes), the target audience (beginners), the programming language (Python), and the library used (PIL).  This provides context and sets expectations.\n\n* **A friendly, inviting aesthetic:** The overall design would likely be clean, colorful, and not overly cluttered to avoid intimidating beginners.  A welcoming font and potentially some illustrative icons could contribute to this feel.\n\nIn short, the image is designed as a visual advertisement and introductory guide, promising a quick and easy introduction to image processing with Python's Pillow library, using visual demonstrations and code examples to attract and inform potential learners.  The image aims to convey the tutorial's simplicity and practicality.]](https://youtu.be/dkp4wUhCwR4)\n\n### Image Processing with ImageMagick\n\n[ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) is a powerful command-line tool for image manipulation, offering features beyond what's possible with Python libraries. It's particularly useful for:\n\n- Batch processing large image collections\n- Complex image transformations\n- High-quality format conversion\n- Creating image thumbnails\n- Adding text and watermarks\n\nBasic Operations:\n\n```bash\n# Format conversion\nconvert input.png output.jpg\n\n# Resize image (maintains aspect ratio)\nconvert input.jpg -resize 800x600 output.jpg\n\n# Compress image quality\nconvert input.jpg -quality 85 output.jpg\n\n# Rotate image\nconvert input.jpg -rotate 90 output.jpg\n```\n\nCommon Data Science Tasks:\n\n```bash\n# Create thumbnails for dataset preview\nconvert input.jpg -thumbnail 200x200^ -gravity center -extent 200x200 thumb.jpg\n\n# Normalize image for ML training\nconvert input.jpg -normalize -strip output.jpg\n\n# Extract dominant colors\nconvert input.jpg -colors 5 -unique-colors txt:\n\n# Generate image statistics\nidentify -verbose input.jpg | grep -E \"Mean|Standard|Kurtosis\"\n```\n\nBatch Processing:\n\n```bash\n# Convert all images in a directory\nmogrify -format jpg *.png\n\n# Resize multiple images\nmogrify -resize 800x600 -path output/ *.jpg\n\n# Add watermark to images\nfor f in *.jpg; do\n    convert \"$f\" -gravity southeast -draw \"text 10,10 'Copyright'\" \"watermarked/$f\"\ndone\n```\n\nAdvanced Features:\n\n```bash\n# Apply image effects\nconvert input.jpg -blur 0x3 blurred.jpg\nconvert input.jpg -sharpen 0x3 sharp.jpg\nconvert input.jpg -edge 1 edges.jpg\n\n# Create image montage\nmontage *.jpg -geometry 200x200+2+2 montage.jpg\n\n# Extract image channels\nconvert input.jpg -separate channels_%d.jpg\n\n# Composite images\ncomposite overlay.png -gravity center base.jpg output.jpg\n```\n\nWatch this ImageMagick tutorial (16 min):\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"ImageMagick Introduction (16 min)\" describes an image that is likely a thumbnail or preview image for an online video tutorial or presentation.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what we can infer and how it would be useful for student assistance:\n\n* **\"ImageMagick Introduction\"**: This indicates the image previews content about ImageMagick, a powerful command-line software suite for image manipulation.

    "content": "## Unicode\n\nEver noticed when you copy-paste some text and get garbage symbols? Or see garbage when you load a CSV file? This video explains why. It covers how computers store text (called character encoding) and why it sometimes goes wonky.\n\nLearn about ASCII (the original 7-bit encoding system that could only handle 128 characters), why that wasn't enough for global languages, and how modern solutions like Unicode save the day by letting us use any character from any language.\n\nSome programs try to guess encodings (sometimes badly!). A signature called BOM (Byte Order Mark)helps computers know exactly how to read text files correctly.\n\nLearn how Unicode, UTF-8 and character encoding works. This is a common gotcha when building apps that handle international text - something bootcamps often skip but developers and data scientists regularly face in the real world.\n\nUnicode is fundamental for data scientists working with international data. Here are key concepts you need to understand:\n\n- **Character Encodings**: Different ways to represent text in computers\n  - ASCII (7-bit): Limited to 128 characters, English-only\n  - UTF-8: Variable-width encoding, backwards compatible with ASCII\n  - UTF-16: Fixed-width encoding, used in Windows and Java\n  - UTF-32: Fixed-width encoding, memory inefficient but simple\n\nCommon encoding issues you'll encounter:\n\n```python\n# Reading files with explicit encoding\nwith open('file.txt', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n    text = f.read()\n\n# Handling encoding errors\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv', encoding='utf-8', errors='replace')\n\n# Detecting file encoding\nimport chardet\nwith open('unknown.txt', 'rb') as f:\n    result = chardet.detect(f.read())\nprint(result['encoding'])\n```\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text describes an educational video thumbnail, likely a still image from a YouTube video or similar online platform.  The image itself probably visually represents the concepts of code pages, character encoding, Unicode, and UTF-8, possibly including a mention of the Byte Order Mark (BOM).\n\n**Here's a breakdown of what the image might contain for student assistance:**\n\n* **Code Pages (Possibly):**  The image might show examples of different code pages (e.g., ASCII, ISO-8859-1) represented visually.  This could be through tables showing character mappings (a numerical code corresponding to a character) or perhaps a graphical representation highlighting the limitations of different code pages (e.g., only supporting certain alphabets or symbols).\n\n* **Character Encoding:** The image might visually explain the general concept of character encoding.  This could be a simple diagram showing how characters are converted into a binary representation (0s and 1s) that a computer can understand. It might use boxes or arrows to illustrate the process.\n\n* **Unicode:**  Likely depicted as a more comprehensive system compared to the older code pages. The image could show how Unicode assigns unique numerical codes (code points) to a vast range of characters from different writing systems globally, solving the limitations of older encodings.\n\n* **UTF-8:**  UTF-8, a specific encoding scheme for Unicode, would probably be highlighted.  It might be shown as a process diagram indicating how it efficiently encodes Unicode code points into variable-length byte sequences.  It might contrast its variable-length nature with fixed-length encodings.\n\n* **BOM (Byte Order Mark):**  The image may show a small representation of a BOM, perhaps as a sequence of bytes at the beginning of a file. An explanation might accompany it, clarifying its purpose in indicating the endianness (byte order) of a file, and why it's sometimes included and sometimes omitted.\n\n**In summary:**  The image aims to visually simplify complex concepts related to character encoding.  It likely uses diagrams, tables, or other visual aids to convey the relationships between these different encoding standards. The 17-minute video duration suggests a detailed explanation, so the image acts as a visual preview or summary of the video's key topics. Students should expect to learn about the evolution of character encoding from limited code pages to the more universal Unicode and its efficient implementation in UTF-8, as well as the role of BOM.]](https://youtu.be/jeIBNn5Y5fI)\n",

    "content": "## Serverless hosting: Vercel\n\n<!--\n\nWhy Vercel? I evaluated from https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#2-cloud-platforms\n\n- AWS, Azure, Google Cloud are too complex for beginners\n- Cloudflare (next most popular, widely admired) Python support is in beta\n- Hetzner (most admired), Supabase (next most admired) do not have a serverless platform\n- Fly.io (next most admired) does not have a free tier\n- Heroku (used in previous terms) is the least admired\n- Vercel is both popular, admired, growing, has a free plan, and a simple API\n\n-->\n\nServerless platforms let you rent a single function instead of an entire machine. They're perfect for small web tools that _don't need to run all the time_. Here are some common real-life uses:\n\n- A contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day)\n- A tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo)\n- A chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question)\n- A newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up)\n- A webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale)\n\nYou only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they're done, these copies disappear. It's cheaper than running a full-time server because you're not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time!\n\nRather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example:\n\n- You can't `pip install` packages - you have to use `requirements.txt`\n- You can't read or write files from the file system - you can only use APIs.\n- You can't run commands (e.g. `subprocess.run()`)\n\n[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is a cloud platform optimized for frontend frameworks and serverless functions. Vercel is tightly integrated with GitHub. Pushing to your repository automatically triggers new deployments.\n\nHere's a [quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/python). [Sign-up with Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup). Create an empty `git` repo with this `api/index.py` file.\n\nTo deploy a FastAPI app, add a `requirements.txt` file with `fastapi` as a dependency.\n\n```text\nfastapi\n```\n\nAdd your FastAPI code to a file, e.g. `main.py`.\n\n```python\n# main.py\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n@app.get(\"/\")\ndef read_root():\n    return {\"message\": \"Hello, World!\"}\n```\n\nAdd a `vercel.json` file to the root of your repository.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"builds\": [{ \"src\": \"main.py\", \"use\": \"@vercel/python\" }],\n  \"routes\": [{ \"src\": \"/(.*)\", \"dest\": \"main.py\" }]\n}\n```\n\nOn the command line, run:\n\n- `npx vercel` to deploy a test version\n- `npx vercel --prod` to deploy to production\n\n**Environment Variables**. Use `npx vercel env add` to add environment variables. In your code, use `os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')` to access them.\n\n### Videos\n\n[[Image Description: The alt text \"Vercel Product Walkthrough\" indicates an image depicting a tutorial or guide on how to use the Vercel platform.  To assist students, a more detailed description would need to know the *content* of the image.  However, based on the alt text alone, we can infer several possibilities and offer a general description to help students understand what to expect:\n\nThe image likely shows a screenshot or series of screenshots demonstrating Vercel's functionalities.  It might include:\n\n* **Interface elements:**  Expect to see elements of the Vercel dashboard, such as menus, buttons, code editors, deployment logs, analytics dashboards, or settings panels.  These elements would be labeled or highlighted to show their relevance in the walkthrough.\n\n* **Step-by-step instructions:**  The image may incorporate numbered steps, arrows pointing to specific interface elements, or callouts explaining actions to take.  This visual guide helps users navigate the platform.\n\n* **Code examples:**  Vercel is a platform for deploying websites and applications, so the image could include snippets of code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) demonstrating how to structure projects for deployment on Vercel.\n\n* **Visual representations of processes:**  There might be flowcharts or diagrams illustrating the deployment process, showing how code is built, tested, and deployed to a live environment.\n\n* **Example projects:**  The image could showcase examples of websites or applications built and deployed using Vercel, serving as inspiration or demonstrating specific features.\n\n\n**To help students further, ask them these questions if they have the image:**\n\n* What specific aspect of Vercel is the walkthrough focusing on (e.g., deployment, serverless functions, preview deployments)?\n* Are there any numbered steps or annotations in the image?  What do they explain?\n* What are the main interface elements highlighted in the walkthrough?\n* Can you identify any code examples or project screenshots?  What technologies are being used?\n\nBy answering these questions, students can create a more comprehensive and helpful description of the \"Vercel Product Walkthrough\" image.]](https://youtu.be/sPmat30SE4k)\n\n[[Image Description: This image is a visual aid for a tutorial titled \"Deploy FastAPI on Vercel | Quick and Easy Tutorial\".  Without seeing the image itself, I can only speculate on its contents, but it likely depicts the steps or concepts involved in deploying a FastAPI application to the Vercel platform.  The image might include:\n\n* **Screenshots:**  Showcasing various stages of the deployment process.  This could include screenshots of the FastAPI code, the Vercel dashboard, the configuration settings (like a `vercel.json` file), and finally, the deployed application running successfully.\n\n* **Flowchart:** A visual representation of the steps involved, outlining the sequence from setting up the project to deploying and testing the application on Vercel.  This would aid understanding the process's flow.\n\n* **Code Snippets:**  Small sections of relevant code, such as the FastAPI code itself, or perhaps the `vercel.json` configuration file showcasing necessary settings for deployment on Vercel.  These snippets would be illustrative, demonstrating key aspects of the deployment process.\n\n* **Diagrams:**  Simple diagrams showing the architecture, illustrating how FastAPI interacts with Vercel's infrastructure. This could visually represent the deployment pipeline.\n\n* **Visual Metaphors:**  Simple icons or illustrations to represent different components (FastAPI, Vercel, server, etc.) to make the process easier to grasp.\n\n\nIn essence, the image aims to provide a visual summary of the tutorial, making the instructions easier to follow and understand. It’s designed to support the written tutorial by providing a concise and clear visual representation of the deployment process.  The student should look for a clear sequence of steps or a logical flow within the image to understand the deployment procedure effectively.]](https://youtu.be/8R-cetf_sZ4)\n",

Without seeing the image itself, I can only speculate on its potential content, offering several possibilities to aid students:\n\n**Possible Image Contents & Descriptions for Student Understanding:**\n\n* **A Diagram Showing the Process:** The image might be a flowchart or diagram illustrating how an LLM processes visual data. This could include steps like:\n    * **Image Input:**  A box showing an image being fed into the system.  The image might be labeled with examples like \"X-Ray,\" \"Satellite Image,\" or \"Photograph.\"\n    * **Feature Extraction:** A box representing the extraction of relevant features from the image (e.g., edges, textures, objects).  This might be linked to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) if the image includes a representation of one.\n    * **Embedding Generation:** A box showing the conversion of visual features into numerical representations (embeddings) that the LLM can understand.\n    * **LLM Processing:** A box showing the LLM processing the embeddings, perhaps highlighting the use of attention mechanisms.\n    * **Output:** A box showing the output, which could be a caption, a description, a classification, or another form of visual understanding. This box could show examples like \"Cat sitting on a mat,\" \"Fracture detected in the left femur,\" or \"High probability of crop failure.\"\n\n* **A Comparison of Methods:** The image could compare different approaches to integrating LLMs and vision, such as:\n    * **Separate Models:**  Showing a CNN processing the image separately, with its output fed into an LLM.\n    * **Unified Models:** Showing a single, integrated model combining CNN and LLM architectures.\n    * **Multimodal Models:** Showing how other data modalities (e.g., text) might be incorporated alongside the image data.\n\n* **Examples of Applications:** The image might show several examples of how LLM vision models are used in various applications, such as:\n    * **Image Captioning:** Showing an image with an automatically generated caption.\n    * **Object Detection:** Highlighting detected objects within an image using bounding boxes and labels.\n    * **Medical Imaging Analysis:** Showing an X-ray with identified anomalies.\n    * **Remote Sensing:** Displaying a satellite image with interpreted geographic features.\n\n**To help students, the description should include:**\n\n* **Clear and concise labels:**  All components of the diagram should be clearly labeled and explained in simple terms.\n* **Simple language:** Avoid technical jargon where possible, or provide definitions for any necessary terms.\n* **Real-world examples:**  Illustrate the concepts with practical applications to make them more relatable.\n* **Key takeaways:**  Summarize the main points of the image in a few bullet points.\n\n\nIn short, without the image, this is the best possible guidance.

To assist students, a detailed description would need to go beyond the alt text.  We can infer potential content based on the description:\n\nThe image likely shows one or more examples of animated data visualizations created using Flourish.  These could include:\n\n* **Types of Charts:**  Several chart types are possible, such as animated bar charts (showing changes over time), line charts (tracking trends), scatter plots (showing correlations), maps (with changing data points), or even more complex visualizations like network graphs or treemaps.  The animation might show data evolving over time, highlighting trends or patterns.\n\n* **Data Representation:** The data itself would be visually represented using color, size, position, and movement. For instance, a bar chart might show the growth of a company's sales over several years, with the bars growing taller as time progresses. A map might show the spread of a disease across a region, with locations changing color intensity over time.\n\n* **Flourish Interface (Possibly):** A portion of the image might subtly show the Flourish interface—perhaps a minimized window or a partially visible toolbar—to reinforce that the visualizations were made using this specific tool.  However, the focus would likely be on the visualizations themselves.\n\n* **Aesthetic Quality:**  The visualization would likely be clean, well-designed, and easy to understand, reflecting Flourish’s reputation for creating professional-looking charts. The color palettes would be consistent and appropriate for the data being presented.  The animations would likely be smooth and not distracting.\n\n\nTo effectively use this image for student assistance, the accompanying text should explain:\n\n* **What Flourish is:** Briefly describe Flourish as a data visualization tool that makes it easy to create interactive and animated charts.\n* **Why animation is useful:**  Explain how animation helps to understand trends and patterns in data over time, making it more engaging and easier to grasp compared to static visualizations.\n* **Examples shown in the image:**  Describe the specific visualizations shown and what kind of data they represent. What story does each visualization tell?  What insights can be gained from them?\n* **How to use Flourish (if applicable):** If the image is used within a tutorial, it could be accompanied by instructions on how to replicate similar visualizations within Flourish itself.\n\n\nIn summary, the image aims to visually demonstrate the power of Flourish for creating dynamic and informative data visualizations, making complex information more accessible and engaging for students.]](https://youtu.be/JrnIu5Bm8i4)\n",

To help students understand the image, we need to break down what it *probably* contains and what they should look for:\n\n**Key Elements to Expect:**\n\n* **Spreadsheet Data:** The image will almost certainly show rows and columns of numerical data within the Excel spreadsheet.  This data likely represents historical data (e.g., sales figures, stock prices, temperature readings) used to create the forecast.  Look for labelled columns (e.g., \"Date,\" \"Sales,\" \"Projected Sales\").  The data might be organized chronologically.\n\n* **Forecast Formula (Possibly):**  Students should look for evidence of formulas used to generate the forecast.  This might be visible in the formula bar at the top of the Excel window, showing the equation used for forecasting (e.g., linear regression, moving average).\n\n* **Chart/Graph:** This is the central element.  The image will use a chart (likely a line chart, but possibly a bar chart or scatter plot) to visually represent the forecast.\n    * **Historical Data:** Part of the chart will show past data (the basis for the forecast).\n    * **Forecast Line/Bars:** A distinct line or bars will extend beyond the historical data, representing the predicted future values.  This projected portion will likely be visually different (e.g., a different color or style) to distinguish it from historical data.\n    * **Labels and Titles:** The chart will have clear labels on the axes (e.g., \"Time\" or \"Date\" on the x-axis, \"Sales\" or \"Value\" on the y-axis) and a title explaining what the chart displays (\"Sales Forecast,\" \"Temperature Prediction,\" etc.).  The legend might clarify what each line or bar represents (historical vs. projected).\n\n* **Excel Features (Potentially):** The image might showcase specific Excel features relevant to forecasting, such as:\n    * **Trendline:** A trendline added to the chart, visually representing the best-fit line through the historical data.\n    * **Forecast Function:**  If Excel's built-in forecasting functions are used, there might be hints of these in the spreadsheet's formulas or the chart's labels.\n\n\n**What Students Should Learn from this Image:**\n\nThe image aims to demonstrate how Excel can be used to:\n\n* **Process numerical data:** Excel's strength in handling large datasets is implied.\n* **Generate forecasts:** Students should see the practical application of forecasting techniques.\n* **Visualize data:** The chart emphasizes the importance of visual representations for understanding trends and predictions.\n* **Communicate findings:** The visual nature of the chart makes it easy to understand the forecast.\n\nIn short, the image serves as a visual example of applying Excel to a common business or analytical task — forecasting future values based on past trends. Students should focus on understanding the data flow (historical data → formula/method → forecast → visual representation).]](https://youtu.be/judFpVgfsV4)\n\n- [Excel File](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a6cSbmZKjX_ZzBsWWrPQwU_4KgRNMwc0/view#gid=1138079165)\n",

Without seeing the image itself, I can only speculate on its contents, but it will probably include some or all of the following elements:\n\n* **Data:** This will be represented visually, perhaps as a large collection of points, a table, or a cloud of data points. It might be labeled \"Training Data,\" \"Input Data,\" or something similar.  The image may highlight the size and potentially the complexity of the data.\n\n* **Algorithm:**  This is the core of the machine learning process. It might be shown as a box or a series of boxes representing different steps in the algorithm (e.g., feature extraction, model training, prediction).  The specific algorithm (e.g., linear regression, decision tree, neural network) might be named or visually hinted at through the diagram's structure.\n\n* **Model:**  This is the output of the training process. It might be depicted as a separate box or as a modified version of the algorithm box, perhaps with emphasized connections. It represents the learned patterns from the data.  The model could be represented abstractly or with a simplified visual representation depending on the complexity of the algorithm.\n\n* **Training:** This process would likely be shown as an arrow or connection between the data and the model, perhaps with a label indicating iteration or learning (e.g., \"Training Iterations,\" \"Model Fitting\").  It might involve visual cues showing how the model improves over time.\n\n* **Prediction/Inference:** This is the application of the trained model to new, unseen data.  It would show a flow from the model to a prediction output, potentially labeled \"Prediction,\" \"Output,\" or \"Results.\"  This could include a visual representation of how the model makes predictions (e.g., drawing a line of best fit in a scatter plot).\n\n* **Evaluation:**  A crucial aspect of machine learning. The image might show a feedback loop or separate box demonstrating how the model's performance is measured (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall). This may involve comparing predicted outcomes to actual outcomes.\n\n* **Feedback Loop:**  Many machine learning processes use feedback to improve the model. This would be represented by a cycle, showing how evaluation results inform adjustments to the algorithm or data pre-processing.\n\nThe overall style of the image might be abstract, using simplified shapes and arrows, or more realistic, depicting actual data visualizations.

The image likely depicts a network graph, a visual representation of relationships between entities.  To assist students, a more detailed description needs further information about what the image actually *shows*.  However, based on the alt text, we can anticipate certain features:\n\n**Expected Elements:**\n\n* **Nodes (Entities):** These will be represented visually, perhaps as circles, squares, or other shapes. Each node likely represents a person, organization, concept, or other element within the network.  The size, color, or other attributes of the nodes might indicate additional information about the entities (e.g., importance, category).\n\n* **Edges (Relationships):** Lines or arrows connecting the nodes. These represent the relationships between the entities. The thickness, color, or type of line might indicate the strength, type, or direction of the relationship. For example, a thick line could represent a strong connection, while a thin line might represent a weak one.  Arrows might indicate a directional relationship (e.g., influence, flow of information).\n\n* **Labels/Annotations:** Text labels are likely present to identify the nodes and perhaps provide additional data.  These labels could be directly on the nodes or displayed separately as a legend.\n\n* **Kumu Interface Elements (Possible):** Depending on the image, it might include elements of the Kumu user interface, such as toolbars, menus, or other controls.  This would help students understand the software's functionality.\n\n* **Overall Layout:** The arrangement of the nodes and edges will communicate the structure of the network.  Some networks will be clustered, showing groups of closely related entities, while others might be more spread out.\n\n\n**How to interpret this for students:**\n\nWhen describing this image to students, emphasize the following:\n\n* **The purpose of network visualization:** Explain that such diagrams help to understand complex relationships and patterns that might be difficult to see in raw data tables.\n\n* **The meaning of nodes and edges:** Clearly define what each node represents and what the connections between them mean in the context of the data being visualized.\n\n* **Interpretation of visual cues:**  Explain how size, color, and shape of nodes and lines are used to communicate information.\n\n* **The advantage of using Kumu (implied):**  Highlight how Kumu makes it easier to create and interact with complex network visualizations.\n\n\nWithout the actual image, this is the most comprehensive description possible.  Providing the image would allow for a much more specific and helpful explanation.]](https://youtu.be/OndB17bigkc)\n\n- [Kumu](https://kumu.io)\n- [IMDB data](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/)\n- [Jupyter Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CHR68fw7lZC9H2JtVW4LXpUvNwfM_VE-?usp=sharing)\n\n[[Image Description: The image titled \"Network analysis – filtering by year\" likely shows a visualization of a network, where connections between nodes (representing individuals, organizations, or concepts) are depicted, and the user can filter this network by year.  To assist students, let's break down what this means and what they might expect to see:\n\n**Key Components:**\n\n* **Network:**  The core of the image is a network graph.  This is a visual representation of relationships.  Think of it like a map, but instead of cities and roads, you have nodes (points or circles) and edges (lines connecting the nodes).  The nodes might represent people, companies, websites, or research papers, while the edges represent relationships such as collaborations, communication, citations, or financial transactions.\n\n* **Nodes:** These are the individual points in the network. Their size, color, or shape might convey additional information, such as importance or a specific attribute of the node.  For instance, larger nodes might represent more influential individuals.\n\n* **Edges:**  These lines connecting the nodes represent the relationships between them.  The thickness of the edge could indicate the strength or frequency of the relationship.  For example, a thicker line could signify more frequent communication.\n\n* **Filtering by Year:** The crucial aspect is the ability to filter the network data by a specific year or range of years.  This means the user can selectively display only the connections that existed during that chosen timeframe.  The image might show a slider, dropdown menu, or other interface element allowing the user to specify the year.\n\n* **Dynamic Visualization:**  It's highly probable that the image depicts a *dynamic* visualization. This means the network's appearance changes in real-time as the user adjusts the year filter.  Edges and nodes might appear or disappear depending on the chosen year.\n\n**What Students Should Understand:**\n\n* **Network Analysis:** This is a powerful technique used to study relationships and patterns within complex systems. Understanding how nodes are connected allows researchers to identify key players, influential groups, and the overall structure of the system.\n\n* **Temporal Dynamics:**  The filtering capability highlights the importance of understanding how networks change over time. Relationships are not static; they evolve, strengthening, weakening, or disappearing entirely. This image allows for the analysis of this temporal evolution.\n\n* **Data Interpretation:** Students should focus on interpreting what the visual representation reveals about the chosen network. What changes occur across different years?  Do certain nodes become more or less central over time?  Are new clusters of nodes forming?  These are the types of questions one might ask when analyzing this type of visualization.\n\n\nIn short, this image provides a snapshot of a powerful tool for analyzing complex systems.  By understanding how networks change over time, researchers can gain crucial insights into diverse phenomena.]](https://youtu.be/oi4fDzqsCes)\n",
